Colocation in an agile context means *all* team members are in the same office.

Current agile is built on the assumption of colocation and this shows up
right in the 12 principles:
`The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.`

Scrum explicitly assumes colocation and the most frequent activity is a face-to-face standup. Kanban practictioners
 [sometimes choose](https://www.conjur.org/blog/running-a-kanban-standup-meeting) a daily meet also.

When the number of remote workers was few it was possible to ignore the problems of insisting on group meetings, but now the
assumption that everyone shares a time zone, much less the same office, is difficult to make.

Colocation, in such an absolute form, was lost quite some time ago. Even if you are a completely co-located team the 
next hire might be remote or the next project require collaboration with a team in another time zone.

### Why can't we just replace face-to-face with virtual?

Calling meetings by default has to go away and be replaced with smart software that
notifies the right people at the right times. Meetings will be held more strategically with the groundwork for the 
meeting already taking place asynchronously.

There are a multitude of reasons for this:
- Virtual is not as good as face to face
- Scheduling across time zones is difficult
- Technology has overtaken some interactions - for instance reporting status face to face no longer makes sense
- The ground work for decisions requiring in depth thinking cannot be done real time
- Face to face meetings tend to not record anything
- Maturity of the software industry - online research and open source are consulted before asking team members

Written communication will replace the face to face meetings scheduled as part of process, and structure will need
to be placed around that communication to keep the signal to noise ratio high.

Fortunately, agile is built on the principle of introspection and adaptation and
practitioners are well prepared to make the necessary changes.
