Colocation in an agile context means that all team members are in the same office.

Current agile is built on the assumption of colocation and this shows up
right in the 12 principles:
`The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.`

Scrum and Kanban explicitly assume colocation, because the most frequent activity
is a face-to-face meeting, the Standup.

Unfortunately, this assumption just isn't true. It was possible to paper over the
problems when it was a few remote workers, but now *nobody* is in the office.

Colocation isn't coming back either. Companies don't have to maintain an expensive
office, and can hire talent wherever they happen to live. Employees don't have to commute, and have a much wider choice of employers.
