So you're a high level coder with autonomy over tool selection. Many 
times you code by yourself, sometimes with a partner, and occasionally 
with a larger team or by directly collaborating with a customer.

Uclusion was built specifically for you, and below we go case by case to
see why it is better than options like simple notes, spreadsheet,
Notion like, GitHub issues, etc. combined with Slack and extra meeting.

## Team of one
The major features Uclusion offers for this use case:
* Status at a glance views
* Backlog organization - two kinds of jobs and three kinds of bugs
* Estimated completion date based reminders
* Moving tasks between jobs and from bug to job and back
* Mark task in progress and optionally remove in progress from others
* Navigation - next button, keystrokes, wizards with focussed buttons
* Mobile interface
* Free forever for one person

If someone joins you coding a new project, you can easily invite them to 
a new workspace and your existing workspace remains private.

## Team of two
For two people many of Uclusion's collaboration features kick in:
* Make a suggestion in a job and the assignee can move it to a task
* Status automatically reflects open questions, suggestions, and blockers
* Slack and email integration - see in channel notifications for critical
bugs and questions that are also available asynchronous
* Job approval and reviews
* Backlog notifications vary by level of job or bug
* Vote on suggestions or question options

Everything above can be handled with more chat and meetings,
but only in a much less satisfying way. With Uclusion when synchronous 
interaction is necessary your agenda is already queued up and half way
done.

## Customer collaboration
When you create a workspace with a customer the ease of use of Uclusion 
really shines:
* Inbox wizards - every notification backed by a wizard with push
button common actions
* Discussion section - suggestions and questions with options are also
top level objects
* Archive a workspace - only pay for users that are active

So everything in Uclusion scales up from simple to advanced usage
without requiring your effort to customize. This principle also
holds for larger teams.

## Team of three plus
The larger a team the more difficulty communication and collaborating 
together. However, with a larger team you also get more help from 
Uclusion:
* Built-in flows prevent bogging down in meetings -
self assigning jobs and bugs, approvals, reviews, estimation, and 
assistance.
* Sanity logic - only an assignee moves a job to approved,
approvals expire, jobs cannot be moved to complete with resolving tasks,
question asker decides on options that can be voted, approvals require
recording a certainty, you can't move a job to assistance without saying
why, top level comments strongly typed, a new review
resolves old ones, a reply can be moved to a task, mentions
affect who is notified and how, critical notifications cannot be 
dismissed without a resolution, and much, much more
* Outbox - track what the team owes you and poke if required

[Signing up](https://uclusion.com) for free puts you directly into a sandbox demo of a larger team in action.
The main difference between that demo and a single person mode workspace 
is the removal from the UI of features that require more than one user.
