Looking back on my 19 years as a developer with some very long stints in positions, I can say this with some certainty:
If you want to remain employable as a developer, you either have the autonomy to completely change how you do things, 
or you should be practicing interview questions. I didn't realize the problem at the time, so I got to learn this 
lesson the hard way: awkward interviews and many hours re-skilling.

### Why autonomy is so important
One of the core responsibilities of a software developer is to solve problems in the best possible way, factoring in
effort and confounding factors. In software, the best way *frequenty changes*. Hardware gets faster, software gets 
better, languages and frameworks arise. If you aren't free to change how you do things, it means you aren't free to do 
your job.

### What happens when you don't have it
Beyond hinting to prospective employers that you've checked out, positions which don't offer autonomy typically have 
relatively ancient software stacks. You will be solving problems the rest of the world has moved on from years ago. You 
might learn things, but the time would have been better spent fixing *today's* problems.

### But wouldn't we spend all of our time re-architecting?
Let's be clear, the problem isn't old code; the problem is someone **wants the old code to continue to grow as a 
product**. If the application is important enough to substantially change, then it's important enough to be on 
technology that allows coding in a reasonable way.

In situations where developers do have autonomy, like open source, you see this all the time. Some repos continue 
to be updated and others become "as is".

### It's not all about the code
Form follows function, and tools and process evolve too. If your company is dictating your development process, or your 
development environment, that is only very slightly removed from telling you what to name that function you're working 
on. This also extends to working hours and whether the office is mandatory. You need to flexibility to work 
the way *you* do the best, or you're hobbling yourself right from the start.

The same principle applies to believing in _what_ you are building. If you don't think the code you are writing will
provide value then stop what you are doing (or at least put as little energy into it as possible while you work on 
interview questions).

### How to get autonomy if you don't have it
Leave. Find a new position that offers it and be sure to ask the questions in David's 
[code factory]({{site.baseurl}}/agile/2021/08/16/code-factory.html) blog to make *sure* they offer it. You could try to 
gain autonomy from within, but if that was likely do succeed why don't you have it in the first place?

### How to provide freedom to change if you are in charge
This isn't the "I heard typescript was cool so let's re-write everything" sort of change. Getting a team of developers 
to agree on anything isn't easy. So if the team says we need X to do our jobs, you should listen.

But without your team even saying anything you should take a look at your process. Are you forcing meetings on
developers? Does your process really include continuous improvement or just endlessly carry forward a wish list that's
never fulfilled?

### A sense of urgency
Now I know what you are thinking because I thought it every day for years - "I need to get more autonomy - I'll start
on that next week." Here's a 
[link](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_compare-majors.html) to the latest
employment numbers for new graduates. At the time of this writing almost a quarter of new graduates are under or 
un-employed. 

The only thing really separating you from their ranks is the ROI you bring to the table and there is a clock ticking
on your abilities.
