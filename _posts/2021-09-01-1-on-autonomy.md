Looking back on my 19 years as a developer with some very long stints in positions, I can say this with some certainty:
If you want to remain employable as a developer, you either have the autonomy to completely change how you do things, or you
should be practicing interview questions. I didn't realize the problem at the time, so I got to learn this lesson the hard way:
awkward interviews and many hours reskilling.

### Why autonomy is so important ###
One of the core responsibilities of a software developer is to solve problems in the best possible way, factoring in
effort and confounding factors. In software, the best way *frequenty changes*. Hardware gets faster, software gets better,
languages and frameworks arise. If you aren't free to change how you do things, it means you aren't free to do your job.

No company on earth is looking for developers who are content to fail at their job.


### What happens when you don't have it ###
Beyond hinting to prospective employers that you've checked out, positions which don't offer autonomy typically have relatively ancient software stacks. You will be solving
problems the rest of the world has moved on from years ago. You might learn things, but it's hard to argue the time wouldn't have
been better spent fixing *today's* problems.

### It's not all about the code ###
Form follows function, and tools and process evolve too. If your company is dictating your development process, or your development environment, that 
is only very slightly removed from telling you what to name that function you're working on. This also extends to 
working hours and whether or not the office is mandatory. You need to flexibility to work when *you* can produce the best output
or you're hobbling yourself right from the start.

### How to get autonomy if you don't have it ###
Leave. Find a new position that offers it and be sure to ask the questions in Davids [code factory] blog to make *sure* they offer it.
You could try to gain autonomy from within, but if that was likely do succeed why don't you have it in the first place?
