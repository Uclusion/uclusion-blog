Working remotely and going to all the same meetings as traditional in office is a bad idea.

1. Tradition communication restricts "deep work" to mostly before and after regular hours. You don't have 
   the commute but end up with much less than the full promise of remote work.
2. With all the video conferencing people start to wonder if face to face isn't better.

Don't take our word for what happens to remote work coupled with traditional communication. Here's
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/distributed-scrum) on the subject:
>A distributed scrum team can benefit from a solid communication plan that includes:
>* Remote work agreements
>* A way to contact other team members for informal questions
>* Establish agreements for how meetings should be structured
>* How team members communicate their availability

Yes "remote work agreements" because what distributed development team morale problem can't be solved by 
lawyers?

### Remote Meetings Lead to Burnout

Introverts or not nearly everyone is going to get something out of the social interaction meetings 
provide. For many developers it just doesn't make up for the annoyance of wasted time.

But Zooming into a call is not the same as gathering in a room. The annoyance
of wasting time and context shifting remains, but the social benefit greatly reduces.

Nor does group chat, no matter how many emojis used, really produce togetherness.

### Only Collaborating to Build Something Together Works

What remote work loses socially it gains in the ability to collaborate. Open offices were a failure
for collaboration. The noise levels caused many to wear headphones, and most discussions ended up in 
meeting room offices anyway.

The larger the team the less reasonable in person communication becomes. Unless the communication is
limited to going around, one by one, a room of engineers standing up. Even for a smaller team it's 
difficult to simultaneously think and keep up with the meeting.

With the right tool online communication breaks through these limits. Design, review, and helping each
other with stories can all increase well beyond simple code reviews.

Continual status comes just as a result of communicating through this tool.

### Is Uclusion Right for Our Team?

As we explain traditional [meeting driven process]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/scrum/2021/06/07/meeting-driven.html) 
comes with a host of problems. If in addition you are attempting to have some teammates or some work days
be remote then you need a tool specifically designed for agile project management without all the meetings.
