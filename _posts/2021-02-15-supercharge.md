### How Uclusion can help

Uclusion has the only collaboration tool that puts your bugs, stories, questions, suggestions, tasks and collaboration
tasks together in one place as equals. But grappling with the new world of asynchronous work can be difficult for any
organization. **So Uclusion also offers free consulting to help you get started.**

Below are some of the topics we can explain in more detail.

### Matching in office collaboration requires more than video conferencing and online white boards

When it works in office collaboration is like a Palmolive commercial - "You're soaking in it." The meetings and 
discussions necessary happen without scheduling or tracking. But that effortless feeling actually comes with some very 
expensive conditions:
1. Extreme collocation - same working hours, same location and open space preferred.
1. Extreme multi-tasking - willingness to drop everything and meet others.
1. Extreme team consistency - collocating with strangers is not the same.

Once any of these conditions breaks down a team has to re-consider their whole approach.

The first thought is to *simulate* those conditions. If you can't be in the same place then be in the same place 
virtually. If the multi-tasking becomes too much then maybe designate some "meeting free" days. If the team is 
changing often - well suck it up.

The problem with simulation is that you likely end up with costs like long commutes or endless meetings but without a 
lot of the collaboration benefit.

### Treat collaboration like work product instead of overhead

Let's step back a second. For all this talk of socializing the office was never about anything more than 
**getting it done**. We know working together is a must, so we need to use technology that treats our 
collaboration tasks like any other task.

Above we don't just track Trafford's story tasks, we can also see he has 3 critical and 3 delayable 
*collaboration tasks*. Its not just assigned that shows for a story but all collaborators as well.

Furthermore our story states are also collaboration states like "Ready for Approval" and 
"Ready for Feedback" shown above but also "Blocked" and "Requires Input" . Our workflow doesn't pre-suppose any 
meetings. Meetings will happen anyway but using tools that rely soley on them ignores their costs to development.

### Even one scheduled meeting can disturb the benefits of remote work

Uclusion attempts an asynchronous workflow for all aspects of development. Closing the last TODO on 
a "Ready for Feedback" story alerts everyone. Opening a high priority bug or unassigned story generates a 
collaboration task to assign it.

When you are on a [maker's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) it's vital to keep it 
empty. If an impromptu meeting, backed by asynchronous preparation, arises that's not the same as already 
facing a calendar full of meetings from the start of the day.

[Schedule](https://calendly.com/uclusion/walk-through) some time with Uclusion and we can help you introduce these 
topics to your team.
