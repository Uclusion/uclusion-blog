### How Uclusion helps

If you want to keep the advantages of remote work it's important to cut down on meetings. If you go to
all the same meetings then two things can happen:
1. Your "deep work" comes mostly before and after regular hours. That's still something since you don't have the
   commute but less than the full promise of remote work.
2. With all the video conferencing people start to wonder if face to face isn't better.

So the less meetings the better and this is what Uclusion does for you. Plus the meetings that still 
happen will be shorter and more focused.

We have a lot of material explaining how we reduce meetings but the short answer is that 
traditional tools don't provide any alternative to meetings. Uclusion does.

### Getting started using Uclusion

To make the power of collaboration without meetings work for you, you just need one collaborator. The difference 
between completely solo and not is vast. So if you are working on a side project at work or at home, 
create a Uclusion Workspace and invite someone to it to help with approvals and reviews. That can 
make a huge difference cutting down on wasted or sloppy work.

Another good way to get started with Uclusion is a hackathon or a temporary collaboration between teams. Just like
remote work, developing software with fewer meetings takes getting used to but the benefits are enormous.


### Introducing your team to Uclusion

Why your boss will love Uclusion:
   * Visibility into the real state of the project. Having the collaboration happen inside the project
     management allows Uclusion to show status at a glance.
   * Finally frees your boss from having to turn down higher priority work in order to avoid disturbing plans made
     in meetings. Nobody wants to work on lower priorities and now with Uclusion's just in time planning you don't 
     have to.

Why your teammates will love Uclusion:
  * Whether they work in office or not, meeting driven process isn't fun for your team. Some of it was
necessary before project management without meetings was available. But now Uclusion has introduced that technology.
  * Meeting driven process makes getting technical debt addressed all or nothing. If you have a meeting
with the agenda of deciding a single goal for the next iteration of development and technical debt is 
    not that goal, then getting any refactoring, infrastructure, etc. done will be a struggle.
    
Don't take our word for what happens to remote work without a tool like Uclusion. Here's
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/distributed-scrum) on the subject:

> A distributed scrum team can benefit from a solid communication plan that includes:
* Remote work agreements
* A way to contact other team members for informal questions  
* Establish agreements for how meetings should be structured
* How team members communicate their availability
