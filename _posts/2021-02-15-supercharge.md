### Matching in office collaboration requires more than video conferencing and online white boards

When it works in office collaboration is like a Palmolive commercial - "You're soaking in it." The meetings and 
discussions necessary happen without scheduling or tracking. But that effortless feeling actually comes with some very 
expensive conditions:
1. Extreme collocation - same working hours, same location and open space preferred.
1. Extreme multi-tasking - willingness to drop everything and meet others.
1. Extreme team consistency - collocating with strangers is not the same.

Once any of these conditions breaks down a team has to re-consider their whole approach.

The first thought is to *simulate* those conditions. If you can't be in the same place then be in the same place 
virtually. If the multi-tasking becomes too much then maybe designate some "meeting free" days. If the team is 
changing membership often - well suck it up.

The problem with simulation is that you likely end up with costs like long commutes or endless meetings but without a 
lot of the collaboration benefit.

### Treat collaboration like work product instead of overhead

Let's step back a second. For all this talk of socializing the office was never about anything more than 
**getting it done**. We know working together is a must, so we need to use technology that treats our 
collaboration tasks like any other task.

Above we don't just track Trafford's story tasks, we can also see he has 3 critical and 3 delayable 
*collaboration tasks*. Furthermore our story states are also collaboration states like "Ready for Approval" and 
"Ready for Feedback" shown above but also "Blocked" and "Requires Input" . Our workflow doesn't pre-suppose any meetings. Meetings will happen anyway but using tools that 
rely soley on them ignores their costs to development.
