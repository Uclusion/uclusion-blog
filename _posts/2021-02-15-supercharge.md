### How Uclusion can help

Uclusion has the only collaboration tool that puts your bugs, stories, questions, suggestions, tasks and collaboration
tasks together in one place as equals. But grappling with the new world of asynchronous work can be difficult for any
organization. **So Uclusion also offers free consulting to help you get started.**

Below are some of the topics we can explain in more detail.

### Matching in office collaboration requires more than video conferencing and online white boards

When it works in office collaboration is like a Palmolive commercial - "You're soaking in it." The meetings and 
discussions necessary happen without scheduling or tracking. But that effortless feeling actually comes with some very 
expensive conditions:
1. Extreme collocation - same working hours, same location and open space preferred.
1. Extreme multi-tasking - willingness to drop everything and meet others.
1. Extreme team consistency - collocating with strangers is not the same.

Once any of these conditions breaks down a team has to re-consider their whole approach.

The first thought is to *simulate* those conditions. If you can't be in the same place then be in the same place 
virtually. If the multi-tasking becomes too much then maybe designate some "meeting free" days. If the team is 
changing often - well suck it up.

The problem with simulation is that you likely end up with costs like long commutes or endless meetings but without a 
lot of the collaboration benefit.

### Treat collaboration like work product instead of overhead

Let's step back a second. For all this talk of socializing the office was never about anything more than 
**getting it done**. We know working together is a must, so we need to use technology that treats our 
collaboration tasks like any other task.

Above we don't just track Trafford's story tasks, we can also see he has 3 critical and 3 delayable 
*collaboration tasks*. Its not just assigned that shows for a story but all collaborators as well.

Furthermore our story states are also collaboration states like "Ready for Approval" and 
"Ready for Feedback" shown above but also "Blocked" and "Requires Input" . Our workflow doesn't pre-suppose any 
meetings. Meetings will happen anyway but using tools that rely soley on them ignores their costs to development.

### Backlogs are bad but they are particularly bad for distributed work

Gathering regularly in one room to discuss an overgrown backlog is a very poor use of time but attempting the same 
meeting with a distributed team is even worse.

In Uclusion a high priority bug or unassigned story generates a collaboration task to assign it. That notification 
remains until someone is assigned or the priority of the bug is reduced. If you want instead to discuss whether or not 
something should be done you can create a suggestion or question with options and collect votes or approvals.
