Let's imagine a two person startup where each co-founder is equal and there are no roles. Now suddenly
any number of corporate trappings of software development fall away:
* There is no 'management' - neither co-founder can fire the other or set their salary
* There are no dedicated roles like program managers, product managers, marketing, sales - anyone can be
assigned anything

One might imagine that in such an environment all [project management](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/project-management-surefire-way-kill-your-software-product)
falls away and the startup is a developer utopia. *That's not what happens.*

Instead all of the pressure to deliver on intermediate milestones remains and *we* are the bad old boss who get's blamed when things don't get done.
So how do we influence productivity in a manager-free environment?

This is where [nudge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory), influencing behaviour without coercion,
comes to the forefront - maybe it's really the most important in more corporate settings also but there are
too many distractions to realize.

The first nudge comes from potential customers. This early paper on [lean startup](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything)
gives the example of Blue River Technology that very quickly learned that robotic lawn mowers for golf courses
were not a viable market and an automated way to kill weeds without chemicals was.

From the nudge theory point of view software developers are surrounded by nudges:
* Language selection - ultimately one can do anything equally in Java and Python with enough effort. However a
language with a HotSpot compiler is going to nudge towards larger, more permanent servers.
* CI/CD tools are a nudge towards quicker deliver cycles.
* Remote technologies are a nudge towards potentially more productive work style options
* Available marketing channels are a nudge towards whatever can be sold via those channels

### Some nudges are the result of mostly external factors but some involve making choices about our environment.

Tools are a nudge under our control and everyone in software development should pay extra attention to them.
