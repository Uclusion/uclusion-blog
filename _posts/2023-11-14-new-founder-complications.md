In my previous startup before Uclusion founder shares were divided very unequally and even with name brand VC 
involvement one founder became paranoid enough to carry around the cap table on his thumb drive.

In Uclusion, we started with a bootstrapped, two person 50 / 50 equity structure and for a while that worked.

## Why equal equity eventually breaks down
First off you can't split the labor equally; inevitably someone will contribute more and over a prolonged period that
will generate friction. Or alternatively there will be a divide in the roles that people perform.

Ah, what about Larry Page and Sergey Brin you say? Well what 
about [Scott Hassan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hassan)? What about Eric Schmidt becoming chairman and CEO of 
Google only three years in? Or even if you go back to Hewlett and Packard, Hewlett was drafted into World War II and 
Packard was not and Packard was president after incorporation and Hewlett was not.

Plus, traditional four year vesting in an environment where the [average time to exit is eight years](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/4-year-founder-vesting-is-dead)
doesn't make any sense, so most startups are on a timer to cap table issues.

## Why unequal equity immediately breaks down
You join a startup to collaborate with others - not report to them. If there were an easy way to get unequal employees
to truly collaborate with each other corporations would find it and startups might not even exist.

The greater the inequality in a startup's cap table the more it becomes just another corporation. Enough like regular
corporations and a VC might as well invest in the stock market.

## How do we work together?
Barely under the surface of the [remote work debate]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/startup/2021/11/02/useless-5.html) lurks
the cap table issue writ large. We want to work *with* others not for them.

Ironically the way in which we work together has become much, much more important than any one product contribution.
This is especially true in tech which is nearly 8% of the workforce and growing. No one product is as important as 
tech workers finding a way for our industry to make work more enjoyable.

Uclusion can no longer split the cap table pie in equal portions, but it can try for equality of labor; you get back
what you put in and all opinions are respected.

This is also where tech in general needs to go. Reports that 
"flattening" [might backfire](https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-management-layoffs-silicon-valley-budgeting-2023-4) misunderstands how jobs work.

> When companies are removing managers, it makes the career path forward not quite as clear.

No actually it's the opposite flattening makes the career path **more** clear - keep contributing to be rewarded.

Google has an average of [one manager per twenty workers](https://www.leadersleague.com/en/news/google-freedom-with-strings-attached), 
compared to the American average ratio of 1:7. Though that's a difficult number to quantify as there is pure HR type 
management, product management, coding managers, project managers, etc.

Of course the startup way of doing things is more productive but management bloat is introduced by the 
cap table. Employees with greater ownership are trusted more than those that are not vesting valuable stock shares.

So, for instance, [Nvidia is very flat](https://twitter.com/danhockenmaier/status/1701608618087571787) compared to most tech companies its size. For Uclusion's cap table a new 
employee must either become an investor or be employed "at will", and "at will" immediately causes a higher level of 
monitoring. 

The problem is not unique to the private sector. In science credit in a discovery is the cap table equivalent making the
difference between Watson and Crick and a [Rosalind Franklin](https://lmuthisweek.lmu.edu/2021/03/22/sexism-in-science-was-rosalind-franklin-robbed-of-a-nobel-prize).
Now as any discovery requires more and more people scientific progress bogs down in cap table issues as well.

The strict dichotomy between working for someone and working with them also plagues the world of open source for profit.
Uclusion uses products like [material ui](https://mui.com/about/) and [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/about)
that must thread a needle of trust between founders, employees, and a community of contributors.

Micromanagement doesn't work for complexity because it reduces the available creativity and feedback. Creativity and 
feedback are the life's blood of handling complexity and reducing it invariably increases the time lost in a 
wilderness of unproductive approaches.

## The useful work exception
As dismal as cap table issues are there is still a partial way around them. People like doing useful work and are
willing to bend the normals rules of compensation to be involved with it. So open source and Wikipedia can exist.

This exception can also be applied in for profit development, but it requires more consensus that the work done is
beneficial. In software development customer feedback comes very late in the cycle. A vision for an MVP or feature might
take months or years to reach the level necessary for customers to provide guidance.

Before that happens you need feedback from the development team or, at a minimum, buy in from the team in order to
get the useful work exception from cap table issues.

## How Scrum, Slack, Jira and products like them make cap table issues worse
Just as useful work can help with cap table issues, other environmental factors can make them worse. Products like
Scrum, Slack, and Jira lean into the urge to micromanage complex work.

Scrum encourages synchronous consensus building during meetings - frequently without advance preparation. The concept
of a "sprint" was intended to solve for organizations that wanted to plan every detail of a project for months. But the
original problem was not detailed long term planning, it was forcing plans on developers without their input. Scrum ends
up encouraging forcing plans in one to three week chunks, and even asking for up front estimates on those chunks.

Similarly synchronous communication in Slack again needlessly increases a developers real time burden. Contrary to its
name Slack makes everything more urgent and difficult to process while doing complex work.

Finally, Jira completes a three-legged micromanaging stool. Bug tracking and product generation are not the same
product. You can't relabel a defect as a "story" and imagine it helps a developer. By positioning ambiguous, agile 
software development as simple tickets that need to be processed, Jira and all other "ticket" based solutions 
deny complexity even exists.

Nor does throwing a simple Kanban board on top of bug tracking fix the problem. Many teams I've worked on resort to
spreadsheets as a better solution than that, but neither the simple Kanban boards nor the spreadsheets help 
with tracking the real workflow of software development tasks with consensus building, questions, suggestions, blockers,
new estimates, reviews, multiple assignees, and a fluidity between bugs, jobs, and the tasks inside of jobs.
