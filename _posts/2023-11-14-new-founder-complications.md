Long story short Uclusion has a demonstrably superior product and is searching for another founder.

In my previous startup before Uclusion founder shares were divided very unequally and even with name brand VC 
involvement one founder became paranoid enough to carry around the cap table on his thumb drive.

So with Uclusion we eventually reached a bootstrapped, two person 50 / 50 equity structure and that was stable for a 
long time.

## Why equal equity eventually breaks down
First off you can't split the labor 50 / 50; inevitably someone will contribute more and over a prolonged period that
will generate friction. Or alternatively there will be a divide in the roles that people perform.

Ah, what about Larry Page and Sergey Brin you say? Well what 
about [Scott Hassan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hassan)? What about Eric Schmidt becoming chairman and CEO of 
Google only three years in?

Or even if you go back to Hewlett and Packard, Hewlett was drafted into World War II and Packard was not and Packard
was president after incorporation and Hewlett was not.

## Why unequal equity immediately breaks down
You join a startup to collaborate with others - not report to them. If there were an easy way to get unequal employees
to truly collaborate with each other corporations would find it and startups might not even exist.

The greater the inequality in a startup's cap table the more it becomes just another corporation. Enough like regular
corporations and a VC might as well invest in the stock market.

## Back to the Uclusion case
Our first problem with the cap table started with incorporation in February 2019. We chose four year vesting
in an environment where the [average time to exit is eight years](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/4-year-founder-vesting-is-dead) and that
doesn't make any sense, especially for a startup that is bootstrapping.

Nearly four years later you can sign up for Uclusion and immediately be put into a sandbox demo that shows just how 
productive those years were. Unfortunately my co-founder was offered a very high level job at Adobe and Adobe invoked 
conflict of interest with their tool specializing in project management for marketing work.

Uclusion specializes in helping developers build products which is very different from people working on marketing but 
still here we are. The finally hardened software we built had not even been deployed to production, and we needed a
new founder or founders.

However, Uclusion cannot return to equality. Even at part-time, I will finish vesting in early 2025 and the new 
founder will always have less than me.

## How do we work together?
Barely under the surface of the [remote work debate]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/startup/2021/11/02/useless-5.html) lurks
the cap table issue writ large. We want to work *with* others not for them.

Ironically the way in which we work together has become much, much more important than any one product contribution.
This is especially true in tech which is nearly 8% of the workforce and growing. No one product is as important as 
tech workers finding a way for our industry to make work more enjoyable.

Uclusion can no longer split the cap table pie in equal portions, but it can try for equality of labor; you get back
what you put in and all opinions are respected.

This is also where tech in general needs to go. Reports that 
"flattening" [might backfire](https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-management-layoffs-silicon-valley-budgeting-2023-4) misunderstands
how jobs work.

> When companies are removing managers, it makes the career path forward not quite as clear.

No actually it's the opposite flattening makes the career path **more** clear - keep contributing to be rewarded.

Google has an average of [one manager per twenty workers](https://www.leadersleague.com/en/news/google-freedom-with-strings-attached), 
compared to the American average ratio of 1:7. That's a difficult number to quantify as there is pure HR type management,
product management, coding managers, project managers, etc.

Of course the startup way of doing things is more productive but management bloat is introduced by the 
cap table. Employees with greater ownership are trusted more than those that are not vesting valuable stock shares.

So, for instance, [Nvidia is very flat](https://twitter.com/danhockenmaier/status/1701608618087571787) compared to 
most tech companies its size.

## Can complex work really be micromanaged?
Again back to Uclusion's seemingly simpler two person case. A new founder would either have to buy in or be employed
"at will". Employed at will would mean, in theory, I watch at all times and dismiss my fellow founder if necessary.

However, is managing a founder really anymore effective than rolling the dice and hoping for the best? The more people 
involved the more complex the problem gets. As a math grad student once told me, "We don't even understand two 
dimensions and some people want to study four."

Nor is the problem unique to the private sector. In science credit in a discovery is the cap table equivalent making the
difference between Watson and Crick and a [Rosalind Franklin](https://lmuthisweek.lmu.edu/2021/03/22/sexism-in-science-was-rosalind-franklin-robbed-of-a-nobel-prize).
Now as any discovery requires more and more people scientific progress bogs down in cap table issues as well.

The strict dichotomy between working for someone and working with them also plagues the world of open source for profit.
Uclusion uses products like [material ui](https://mui.com/about/) and [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/about)
that must thread a needle of trust between founders, employees, and community of contributors.

Complex work cannot be micromanaged, but you can ride the wave of good will that attends any useful work.
