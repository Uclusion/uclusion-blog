Long story short Uclusion has a demonstrably superior product and is searching for another co-founder but startup 
structure makes it difficult.

My previous startup before Uclusion also ran into trust trouble. Founder shares were divided very
unequally and even with name brand VC involvement one founder became paranoid enough to carry around the cap table on
his thumb drive.

So with Uclusion we eventually reached a bootstrapped, two person 50 / 50 equity structure and that was stable for a 
long time. My co-founder had take a job after two years and I had to take a job after three years, but we just adjusted
the vesting rate according to how many hours we could contribute.

## Why equal equity eventually breaks down
First off you can't split the labor 50 / 50; inevitably someone will contribute more and over a prolonged period that
will generate friction. Or alternatively there will be a divide in the roles that people perform.

Ah, what about Larry Page and Sergey Brin you say? Well what 
about [Scott Hassan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hassan)? What about Eric Schmidt becoming chairman and CEO of 
Google only three years in?

Or even if you go back to Hewlett and Packard, Hewlett was drafted into World War II and Packard was not and Packard
was president after incorporation and Hewlett was not.

## Why unequal equity immediately breaks down
You join a startup to collaborate with others - not report them. If there were an easy way to get unequal employees
to truly collaborate with each other corporations would find it and startups might not even exist.

The greater the inequality in a startup's cap table the more it becomes just another corporation. Enough like regular
corporations and a VC might as well invest in the stock market.

## Back to the Uclusion case
Our first problem with the cap table started with incorporation in February 2019. We chose four year vesting and
in an environment where 
the [average time to exit is eight years](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/4-year-founder-vesting-is-dead) that
doesn't make any sense, especially for a startup that is bootstrapping.

Nearly four years later you can sign up for Uclusion and immediately be put into a sandbox demo that shows just how 
productive those years were. Unfortunately my co-founder was offered a very high level job at Adobe and Adobe invoked 
conflict of interest with their tool specializing in project management for marketing work.

Uclusion specializes in helping developers build products which is very different from people working on marketing but 
still here we are. The finally hardened software we built had not even been deployed to production, and we needed a
new founder or founders.

However, Uclusion cannot return to equality. Even at part-time, I will finish vesting my 50% in early 2025 and the new 
founder will always have less than me.

## How do we work together?
Barely under the surface of the [remote work debate]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/startup/2021/11/02/useless-5.html) lurks
the cap table issue writ large. We want to work *with* others not for them.

Ironically the way in which we work together has become much, much more important than any one product contribution.
This is especially true in tech which is nearly 8% of the workforce and growing.

Uclusion can no longer split the cap table pie in equal portions, but it can try for equality of labor; you get back
what you put in and all opinions are respected.

This is also where tech in general needs to go. Reports that 
"flattening" [might backfire](https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-management-layoffs-silicon-valley-budgeting-2023-4) misunderstands
how jobs work.

> When companies are removing managers, it makes the career path forward not quite as clear.

No actually it's the opposite flattening makes the career path **more** clear - keep contributing to be rewarded.
