**TL;DR**: signup for [Uclusion](https://uclusion.com) and immediately be in a sandbox demo (a very small sample shown 
below) with a team enjoying a modern development process.

## Asynchronous support for deciding what to do
A lot of the code a team writes will not be useful or have to be rewritten a better way later. It's the number one 
problem of almost any developer. Most teams have three tools they can use to 
prevent [code factory](/startup/2021/08/16/code-factory.html) - meetings, design documents, and code reviews.

The only process workflow tooling that developers have currently is around code reviews and a little
bit for design documents and that's bettern than nothing. However, important workflows like
  - job approval
  - job review
  - job assistance
  - proposal discussion

deserve the deeper thought that comes outside of meetings also. Below you see an asynchronous way for the team to 
approve each others assignments and a notification system that helps process approvals:

  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/approval.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video class="vid-mobile" width="340" height="600" muted loop controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/approvalMobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Unstructured comments with mentions and group chat are too rudimentary to even beat meetings for 
this purpose. When a question is asked the team needs an asynchronous way to add and vote on options
for that question:

<video class="vid" width="1200" height="600" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/voteQuestion.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video class="vid-mobile" width="340" height="600" muted loop controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/voteQuestionMobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

There are many more workflows for helping decision-making in Uclusion. Plus the input from these workflows also powers 
status views.

## An alternative to mandatory daily meetings
A second category of workflow tooling is necessary to prevent administrivia meetings:

  - self assigning jobs / bugs 
  - job estimation 
  - team status view 
  - what I owe / what others owe me views

Below are a couple of examples but there are many, many more.

When a question, suggestion or blocker is opened in a job, the job is automatically moved to needs assistance stage:

<video class="vid" width="1200" height="600" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swimlanes.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video class="vid-mobile" width="340" height="600" muted loop controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swimlanesMobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Similarly, after a few days in approved stage with no estimate or an expired estimate, Uclusion enforces the input of 
an estimated completion date. If one is not provided the job is automatically moved back to the assigned stage.

<video class="vid" width="1200" height="600" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/estimate.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video class="vid-mobile" width="340" height="600" muted loop controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/estimateMobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

This estimate can be changed at any time and a notification of the change will be sent to the group.
