**TL;DR**: signup for [Uclusion](https://uclusion.com) and immediately be in a sandbox demo (a very small sample shown 
below) with a team enjoying a modern development process.

## Asynchronous support for deciding what to do
A lot of the code a team writes will not be useful or have to be rewritten a better way later. It's the number one 
problem of almost any developer. Most teams have three tools they can use to 
prevent [code factory](/startup/2021/08/16/code-factory.html) - meetings, design documents, and code reviews.

The only process workflow tooling that developers have currently is around code reviews and a little
bit for design documents and that has successfully reduced a lot of meetings. However, important workflows like
  - job approval
  - job review
  - job assistance
  - proposal discussion

deserve alternatives to meetings also. Part of that tooling is a process aware inbox:

  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/approval.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Unstructured comments with mentions and group chat are too rudimentary to even beat meetings for this purpose.

<video class="vid" width="740" height="400" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/voteQuestion.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Plus the input from these workflows must also power status views.

## An alternative to mandatory daily meetings
A second category of workflow tooling is necessary to prevent administrivia meetings:

  - self assigning jobs / bugs 
  - job estimation 
  - team status view 
  - what I owe / what others owe me views

Here the team status view knows when a job needs assistance:

<video class="vid" width="740" height="400" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swimlanes.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

After a few days with no estimate or an expired estimate, Uclusion enforces the input of an estimated completion date 
on any accepted job. If one is not provided the job is automatically moved back to the approval stage.

<video class="vid" width="740" height="400" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/estimate.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

This estimate can be changed at any time and a notification of the change will be sent to the group.
