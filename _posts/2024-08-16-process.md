title:  "The unpleasantness of default dev process"

For CI/CD, IDEA, coding language, or cloud infrastructure, we all make certain to be on the latest
and greatest available. Unfortunately for dev process most teams end up on very old defaults.

For a non-coding manager that default is Scrum. Scrum is better than handing developers
a specification so detailed that it might as well be code. Such a spec is invariably filled with guesses or an entire 
wrong direction.

However, Scrum usually starts by setting a product direction in stone and then proceeds to hand out small specifications 
every sprint. That means the dev team's input is excluded from real decision-making and so that's a 
recipe for making bad choices.

For developers able to choose their own process the default is "nothing" - just do whatever seems right without 
thinking much about process.

Intuitively "nothing" seems like a winner but imagine you took the same attitude towards CI/CD; just organically write 
tests and try to automate delivery without considering the kind of testing or researching a GitHub actions.

"Nothing" uses the same [30-year-old tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/startup/2024/05/30/work-env.html) as Scrum - tickets, 
chat, and meetings and there is a lot of pressure to get coding. So the result is either a Scrummy bunch of meetings or
no clear team opinion on what is being implemented.

*Bias acknowledgement: your new dev process should run on [Uclusion](https://uclusion.com).*

### A process without formal approvals is unpleasant ###
Ongoing team opinion is the best defense against [code factory](http://localhost:4000/startup/2021/08/16/code-factory.html).
Not rubber stamp the PM, not customer X asked for it, and not this project was socialized before
we started it.

Team members have to give deep thought to what and how and be able to back out or change things later. Producing 
software that sells is very difficult so you need a process that makes it easy to continually record the individual 
approval of each team member.

The closest traditional dev process comes to formal approvals is code review. Unfortunately, code
reviews are late in the game to regulate how and way, way too late to regulate what.

### A process without formal questions and suggestions is unpleasant ###
Project management systems are designed to track certainty. This ticket with this date and no mechanism to change that 
date, another requirement of a good dev process. Such systems don't track questions or suggestions (except as 
unstructured comments) and opinions on them, because they don't admit ambiguity exists.

Nor is chat or meetings any better for questions and suggestions. The informal approach requires
taking up everyone's time, getting back answers that are not thought through, and not showing
assistance still required as part of status.

So some dev process write up an entire spec ahead of time and get the questions and suggestions
addressed in it. This is the much maligned "waterfall" approach where one ends up doing the 
equivalent of a code review on a much less precise language.

The other problem with waterfall is [planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy):

>The planning fallacy was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979.
In 2003, Lovallo and Kahneman proposed an expanded definition as the tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and 
risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits of the same actions. 
According to this definition, the planning fallacy results in not only time overruns, but also 
cost overruns and benefit shortfalls.

The key phrase there is "benefit shortfalls". Don't encourage someone to write up an entire spec
because then you are again usually too late to shut down the idea.

### Using tools not built for dev process is unpleasant ###
Of course, you can use a crummy dev tool and still get by - instead of CI/CD build on your laptop and SCTP to a server. 
There is a productivity hit but there is also a morale hit - good tools make you feel good about what you 
are doing.

CI/CD is itself a dev collaboration process with supporting tools. If you build everything on
your laptop then not only is it a pain to keep your laptop up to date, but it is very difficult to release regularly 
with others.

Tickets / Kanban boards, meetings, and chat are general purpose tools not designed for dev process 
(see link above Kanban boards were actually designed for 1970s factories). You can still use them for dev process,
but it's like building for production from your laptop.
