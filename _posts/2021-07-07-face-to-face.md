Last century's way of doing things isn't just annoying; it's dangerous.

For instance if a particular organization
[likes group code review](https://buildingvts.com/how-to-host-a-group-code-review-61345dbc7b98)
that's fine. The dangerous part is making it mandatory across organizations and 
not providing asynchronous tool support. That's the effect of making something 
an official "ceremony".

Imagine if all software development teams required group code review meetings.
  * There would be an impact for distributed work, remote work and depending on the 
time of the meeting, additional rush hour commutes.
  * You would sometimes be blocked waiting for the next group code review meeting.
  * Each team would have to be careful not to take on more work than can be
reviewed in the code review ceremony.
  * The meeting skills necessary to successfully navigate a group code review
would become more important.
  * Reviews done in the meeting might suffer from time constraints.
  * **Code review tools would not exist.**

### Mandatory is not Self-Organizing
The craziness of a forced group code review ceremony doesn't happen because code 
reviews are self-organizing. Developers decide for themselves when asynchronous
is sufficient and when to call a meeting.

As you can read in our blogs, that's not the case for
[planning]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2021/06/29/planning.html), 
[retrospective]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2020/11/15/less-ceremony.html),
[daily]({{ site.baseurl }}/startup/remote/2021/02/15/standup.html) and
[Sprint review]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/startup/2020/12/04/demo.html) ceremonies.

Even if a development team takes all ceremonies as suggestions, they will still
need the right asynchronous tool to explore alternatives.

Being on a team that's not self-organizing causes a multitude of software 
development career dangers. The projects of passive teams tend to fail, and that
makes for a toxic environment. Both the technical and non-technical skills 
acquired in such an environment usually fall short of self-organized peers.

**Self-organizing is not all or nothing.** With the right tool,
each of the above ceremonies represents a different area that can be 
self-organized as code reviews usually are.

### Coding and Managing

You can have your technical skills and greater responsibility as well, but
it requires being smart with your time. Meeting driven process is too 
time-consuming to allow for much leadership.

Plus a team that is spoon-fed its process is likely to expect everything to
be decided for them or even regress to needing constant attention.

### The Right Tool
Meeting driven process interconnects. So instead of a tool per meeting,
find one tool, like Uclusion, designed for your entire process. Without that
tool you are stuck on mandatory meetings and so is your career.
