Last century's way of doing things isn't just annoying; it's dangerous.

For instance if a particular organization
[likes group code review](https://buildingvts.com/how-to-host-a-group-code-review-61345dbc7b98)
that's fine. Now imagine all software development teams require group code 
review meetings to fulfill an "agile ceremony".
  * There would be an impact for distributed work, remote work and depending on the 
time of the meeting, additional rush hour commutes.
  * You would sometimes be blocked waiting for the next group code review meeting.
  * Work per iteration limited to what can be reviewed in the code review ceremony.
  * Meeting skills would become more important.
  * Reviews done in the meeting might suffer from time constraints.
  * **Code review tools would not exist.**

CI/CD is another example of developers and asynchronous tools used instead of 
meetings. Where once there were regular meetings to approve batches of 
changes now many organizations have automated testing and continuous releases.

Current agile meetings are no different - last century's guidance to 
synchronously batch process lacks the flexibility to succeed.

### Mandatory is not Self-Organizing
The craziness of a forced group code review ceremony doesn't happen because code 
reviews are self-organizing. Developers decide for themselves when asynchronous
is sufficient and when to call a meeting.

As you can read in our blogs, that's not the case for
[planning]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2021/06/29/planning.html), 
[retrospective]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2020/11/15/less-ceremony.html),
[daily]({{ site.baseurl }}/startup/remote/2021/02/15/standup.html) and
[Sprint review]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/startup/2020/12/04/demo.html) 
ceremonies. Even if a development team takes all ceremonies as suggestions, they
will still need the right asynchronous tool to explore alternatives.

**Self-organizing is not all or nothing.** With the right tool,
each of the above ceremonies represents a different area that can be 
self-organized as code reviews usually are.

Not self-organizing fails the demands of the future, and the 
technical and non-technical skills acquired fall behind.

### Coding *and* Managing

You can have your technical skills and greater responsibility as well, but
it requires being smart with your time. Meeting driven process is too 
time-consuming to allow for much leadership.

Plus a team that is spoon-fed its process is likely to expect everything to
be decided for them or even regress to needing constant attention.

### The Right Tool
Meeting driven process interconnects. So instead of a tool per meeting,
find one tool, like Uclusion, designed for your entire process. Without that
tool you are stuck on mandatory meetings and so is your career.
