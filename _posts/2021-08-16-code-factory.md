Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when spoon-fed as much instruction as possible. 

That engineering autonomy should be limited whenever possible like the automation that runs a factory. A code factory 
shouldn't be confused with a sweat shop; it's not about the number of hours per day spent coding. Factory work might
even be pleasant but this environment limits you from reaching your full potential.

How do you know if you work in a code factory?

1. **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Single point of failure** - developer ideas maybe snuck in skunk works, hidden inside top-down projects or 
churned out in hack-a-thons, but mostly initiatives come from a single source.
3. **Top-down organized** - Inflexible methodology, report heavy tools and forcibly assigned projects are common. You 
may work on a team but the only opinion that matters to you is your manager, team lead, product manager or 
chief architect - depending on the situation.
4. **Meaningless deadlines** - top-down projects have hard deadlines that are then usually pushed. The deadline theater
is more about taking design choices away from developers that would prefer not to add more technical debt.
5. **Limited career paths** - code factories don't offer many paths forward for developers unless 
they become managers.
6. **Cliques** - since there are reduced opportunities to prove yourself, relationships based on reporting structure 
and proximity play a larger role.
7. **Atrophied skills** - code factories typically have their own way of doing things that's out of
touch with the latest technology and methodologies. Plus your decision-making muscle and domain knowledge stays 
under-developed.

Spoon-feeding developers causes contempt for the entire engineering team. An organization that instead prizes the 
team and culture its built might think nothing of re-writing entire sections of their code base or innovations designed 
for new markets.

>**The longer it takes to make progress the more likely management stops listening to the team.**

Here's where things get interesting though - the converse is also true. The longer it takes to make progress the more 
likely management stops listening to the team. Grunt labor leads to more grunt labor and a lack of trust and motivated 
engineers to fix the architecture and process problems behind the slow-down.

Unless you're on a team of select PHds cracking a nearly unsolvable puzzle, using the tools and methodology that helps 
you build the best, fastest is vital to avoiding collapsing into a code factory.

So is code factory a condition that can be overcome? We'll explore that question in our next blog.
