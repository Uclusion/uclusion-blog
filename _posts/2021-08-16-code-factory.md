Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when spoon-fed as much instruction as possible. 

That engineering autonomy should be limited whenever possible like the automation that runs a factory. A code factory 
shouldn't be confused with a sweat shop; it's not about the number of hours per day spent coding. Factory work might
even be otherwise pleasant but this environment limits you from reaching your full potential.

How do you know if you work in a code factory?

1. **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Rubber stamping** - Ideas from the manager, team lead, product manager or chief architect are warmly received 
without alternative.<br/><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sopranos-paulie-gualtieri.gif" alt="Laugh at my joke" style="width: 50%;" /><br/>Not 
that anyone necessarily wants it that way; there might even be agile meetings and hack-a-thons to try get everyone
involved. Unfortunately getting everyone involved is not simple - more on that in the next blog.
3. **Meaningless deadlines** - top-down projects have hard deadlines that are then usually pushed. The deadline theater
is more about taking design choices away from developers that would prefer not to add more technical debt.
4. **Its sooo slow** - removing decision-making and innovation from the great majority of an engineering organization
makes it the opposite of agile.<br/><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sloth-gif.gif" alt="Sloth" style="width: 50%;" />
5. **Limited career paths** - code factories don't offer many paths forward for developers unless 
they become managers.
6. **Cliques** - since there are reduced opportunities to prove yourself, relationships based on reporting structure 
and proximity play a larger role.
7. **Atrophied skills** - code factories typically have their own way of doing things that's out of
touch with the latest technology and methodologies. Plus your decision-making muscle and domain knowledge stays 
under-developed.

Spoon-feeding developers causes contempt for the entire engineering team. An organization that instead prizes the 
team and culture its built might think nothing of re-writing entire sections of their code base or innovations designed 
for new markets.

>**The longer it takes to make progress the more likely management stops listening to the team.**

However, even when all engineers ideas are considered it doesn't guarantee things stay that way. The longer it takes to 
make progress the more likely management stops listening to the team. The lack of stake-holder trust leads to 
more grunt labor and fewer motivated engineers to fix the architecture and process problems behind the slow-down.

So, unless you're on a team of select PHds cracking a nearly unsolvable puzzle, using the tools and methodology that 
helps build the best, fastest is vital to avoiding collapsing into a code factory.

Then is code factory a condition that can be overcome? More on that in the next blog also.
