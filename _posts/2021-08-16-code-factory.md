Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when spoon-fed as much instruction as possible. 

That engineering autonomy should be limited whenever possible like the automation that runs a factory. A code factory 
shouldn't be confused with a sweat shop; it's not about the number of hours per day spent coding. Factory work might
even be otherwise pleasant but this environment limits you from reaching your full potential.

## How do you know if you work in a code factory?

1. **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Rubber stamping** - Ideas from the manager, team lead, product manager or chief architect are warmly received 
without alternative.<br/><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sopranos-paulie-gualtieri.gif" alt="Laugh at my joke" style="width: 50%;" /><br/>Not 
that anyone necessarily wants it that way; there might even be agile meetings and hack-a-thons to try get everyone
involved. Unfortunately getting everyone involved is not simple - more on that in the next blog.
3. **Meaningless deadlines** - top-down projects have hard deadlines that are then usually pushed. The deadline theater
is more about taking design choices away from developers that would prefer not to add more technical debt.
4. **Its sooo slow** - removing decision-making and innovation from the great majority of an engineering organization
makes it the opposite of agile.<br/><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sloth-gif.gif" alt="Sloth" style="width: 50%;" />
5. **Limited career paths** - code factories don't offer many paths forward for developers unless 
they become managers.
6. **Cliques** - since there are reduced opportunities to prove yourself, relationships based on reporting structure 
and proximity play a larger role.
7. **Atrophied skills** - code factories typically have their own way of doing things that's out of
touch with the latest technology and methodologies. Plus your decision-making muscle and domain knowledge stays 
under-developed.

## Why do code factories happen?

One common misconception about code factories is that they are the result of an engineering team that lacks skills. 
Many times though an engineering team collapses from having everyone's ideas considered to only being able to implement 
them skunk works. Or an engineer that performs at a senior level is relegated to junior simply for joining a code 
factory.

Spoon-feeding causes contempt for the entire engineering team whether they need spoon-feeding or not. An 
organization that instead prizes the team and culture its built might think nothing of re-writing entire sections of 
their code base or innovations designed for new markets.

>**The longer it takes to make progress the more likely management stops listening to the team.**

Think of trust in an engineering team as directly related to return on investment in that engineering team. The longer 
it takes to make progress the more likely management stops listening to the team. However, the lack of progress could
happen for many reasons, which causes less developer autonomy, which leads to fewer motivated engineers, which
results in more slow down.

So, unless you're on a team of select PHds cracking a nearly unsolvable puzzle, using the tools and methodology that 
helps build the best, fastest is vital to avoiding spiraling into a code factory.

Then is code factory a condition that can be overcome? More on that in the next blog also.
