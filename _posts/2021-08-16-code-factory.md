Factory work is optimized to product goods designed elsewhere. 

In software development a code factory shouldn't be confused with a sweat shop; it's not about the number of hours per 
day spent coding. How do you know if you work in a code factory?

1. **You don't know reasons** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Backdoor bottom-up ideas** - developer ideas are snuck in skunk works, hidden inside top-down projects or churned
out in hack-a-thons. There may even be a lot of code produced this way but all without the support of front door 
process, tools and reward mechanisms.
3. **Lots of fire fighting and poor infrastructure** - solving immediate problems seen as more valuable than preventing 
future ones since no trust required
4. **Gold plated external ideas** - big customer asks and legal requirements from outside the organization are 
especially shiny even if nobody really wants them.
5. **Over customization** - APIs are much looser and configuration much more complex than they should be because 
detailed analysis doesn't come top down
6. **Crappy project management** - Out of the box methodology and report heavy tools are frequently chosen by external 
trends and top-down choice
7. **Deadline theater** - top-down projects have hard deadlines that are then usually pushed. Its more about taking the
decision of being done away from developers.
8. **Fake MVPs** - MVP is the least work necessary to get further feedback but code factory MVPs are really about trying
to push the decision-making onto customers. Unfortunately, "This is crap." is not useful feedback.
9. **Fungible developers** - developer decision-making muscle and domain knowledge stays under-developed or becomes 
atrophied so everyone is equally replaceable
10. **Developer career paths limited** - code factories don't offer many paths forward for developers unless they become 
managers
