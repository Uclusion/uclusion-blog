Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when directed as much as possible.

They might not be sweatshops but the spoon-feeding severely limits your prospects. First, developers are not trusted 
enough to change architecture so if you want current skills, you will need a side gig. 

Second, code factories limit collaboration and leadership skills. That makes achieving any position of _real_ 
responsibility much harder. (You can become management within the code factory but that's just baby-sitting.)

## How do you know if you work in a code factory?
1. **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Rubber stamping** - ideas from "above" are presented without alternatives, or opportunity for input.
3. **Emphasis on getting 'done'** - projects have unexplained hard deadlines and no room for feedback loops.
4. **Limited teamwork** - developers do not engage much with their peers.

If you see any of 1 through 4 where you work then read on. Otherwise check out

## How to find a job outside a code factory
There are plenty of examples of autonomous teams:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="padding-right: 3rem">Company</th>
      <th>Bottom up example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Google</td>
      <td>20% time policy leads to many new products</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Amazon</td>
      <td>Bottom up New Product Introduction process resulted in AWS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Apple</td>
      <td>iPhone started as a skunkworks project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Facebook</td>
      <td>Embraces open source</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Netflix</td>
      <td>Freedom and responsibility culture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spotify</td>
      <td>Emphasis on team autonomy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Slack</td>
      <td>Their group chat began as an internal tool</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Instagram</td>
      <td>Thirteen person company when acquired by Facebook</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br />
However, if you decide to leave, "agile process", remote work or managers that code doesn't say anything about code 
factory. Here are some questions to investigate a team you are interviewing with:
* Who chooses the software development process? Similarly are teams allowed detours from the "paved road" 
architecture or is infrastructure centralized?
* How much power do PMs have? Engineering effectively reporting to a small group responsible for all idea generation 
is different from PMs making suggestions.
* Are engineering teams siloed by location or function? Do they have a sustaining team dedicated to technical debt? 
Either might mean development teams lack the autonomy to manage their architecture and quality.
* Does the management come from companies with a reputation for flexibility? The culture of previous jobs frequently 
influences the level of autonomy they encourage.
* How aligned is their tech stack with the latest technology? Code factories tend not to update.

Also making your current employer better lets you wait longer for the right fit.

## How to make your current position tenable
Many teams have the technical skills to succeed but are wasting time pushing rocks up a hill. Assuming you 
don't want to work yourself to death, your team must drop some rocks: bloated and ineffective process, poor 
prioritization, and technical debt. 

**By far the most impact can be had by fixing process**, because bad process _causes_ developers to spend time on 
things with low return. That in turn makes old technical debt remain, which eats up available time, which forces even 
more shortcuts.

You don't have to fix all of your process at once. Perhaps you already have a meeting like a retro or a hack-a-thon 
whose time can be reclaimed with something more effective.

Some suggestions for the new process:
1. It should be truly continuous - not reliant on "Sprints" or periodic meetings and events. That way whenever you have 
time, you can work on it asynchronously.
2. It should record ROI-centric approvals. IE team and stakeholder opinions are visible.
3. Pick project management tools that work for you. Instagram famously ran from tasks listed in a single elaborate
Google Doc, but hopefully you can do better.
4. The new process can run in parallel but should be eventually extendable to all the team's work.

## Good luck
It's a big step so let's review why going beyond code factory is necessary. 

{% include callout.html

Here's an excerpt from a Netflix senior software engineer position:
>* Work closely with our customers & partners, understand their use cases & needs, think strategically to seek the right problem to solve at the right time, and innovate with rigor.
* Collaborate with the team to be responsible for the entire software lifecycle.
* Work on, collaborate with, and influence the open-source community, and have an impact in the industry.

Solving problems outside of code factory spoon-fed process and requirements includes all the skills you need to get to 
another level. Plus your employer could use the help!
