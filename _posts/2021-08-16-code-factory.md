Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when directed as much as possible.

Unfortunately this severely limits career growth and future prospects. Unlike sweatshops, however, they may be 
pleasant places to work, if you don't mind the negative attributes that code factories share.

## How do you know if you work in a code factory?
1. **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Rubber stamping** - ideas from "above" are presented without alternatives, or opportunity for input.
3. **Emphasis on getting 'done'** - projects have unexplained hard deadlines and no room for feedback loops.
4. **Limited teamwork** - developers do not engage much with their peers.

If 1 through 4 match a lot of what you experience, and it does upset you then read on.

## How to escape?
Working in a code factory might make you think that top-down is the only way corporate software development
works but that's not true. For example:

| Company     |  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bottom up example |
| --- | --- |
| Google      | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20% free time policy leads to many products |
| Amazon      | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bottom up New Product Introduction process resulted in AWS |
| Apple       | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iPhone started as a skunkworks project |
| Facebook    | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Embraces open source |
| Netflix     | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Freedom and responsibility culture |
| Spotify     | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Emphasis on team autonomy |
| Slack       | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their group chat began as an internal tool |
| Instagram   | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thirteen person company when acquired by Facebook  |

However, if you decide to leave, identifying the level of code factory of a team during the interview process 
is tricky.

### Job seeking
Here are some tips for spotting a code factory from the outside but there is no reliable formula:
* A company advertising an "agile process" or remote work doesn't tell you anything about whether it is a code factory.
* Do they follow a _mandated_ software development process?
* Do they have a sustaining team dedicated to technical debt? That might mean development teams lack the autonomy to 
manage their architecture and quality.
* Are teams allowed detours from the "paved road" architecture or is infrastructure mostly centralized?
* Is there separate product management and how much power do PMs have? Engineering effectively reporting to a small 
group responsible for all idea generation is different from PMs making suggestions.
* If the team is led by a technical manager how much collaboration on his/her code and ideas?
* Are engineering teams siloed or distributed? Code factories are more likely to be siloed since it pairs well with 
top-down.
* Check out the engineering management resumes. The culture of previous jobs frequently influences the level of 
autonomy they encourage.

Even if you are job seeking, its best if finding a new position is not your only angle on escaping code factory.

### Reclaiming wasted time
Assuming you don't want leaving to be your only option, then you're going to need a team that is capable of executing 
quickly and efficiently by itself. To accomplish that without working yourself to death, you and your team will have to 
make full use of the time available to you.

Many code factory teams have the skills to succeed but are wasting time pushing rocks up a hill. These rocks tend to 
come in three categories: bloated and ineffective process, poor prioritization, and technical debt. 

**By far the most impact can be had by fixing process**, because bad process _causes_ developers to spend time on 
things with low return. That in turn makes old technical debt remain, and eats up available time which forces even more 
shortcuts.

In other words, if you want to stop working in a code factory, focusing solely on your own technical excellence won't 
be enough.

### Self-organizing for technical debt
Code factories frequently orphan technical debt and that makes it a great place to start. Perhaps you already have
a meeting like a retro or a hack-a-thon whose time can be reclaimed with something more effective.

Some suggestions for the new process:
1. It should be truly continuous - not reliant on "Sprints" or periodic meetings and events. That doesn't mean you 
will be able to contribute to it all the time; just that whenever you have time, you can work on it asynchronously.
2. It should include an easy team approval mechanism. You don't want to waste your time on anything that's not agreed
to be high ROI.
3. Pick project management tools that work for you. Instagram famously ran from tasks listed in a single elaborate
Google Doc, but hopefully you can do better.
4. The new process should be eventually extendable to all the team's work.

Attempting any form of self-organizing puts all the cards on the table one way or the other. Either your team will have 
a new and better way of doing some things, or you'll know exactly where your organization stands on developer autonomy.
