In this series we explore more hierarchical environments, starting with what we call the "code factory".

Factories are optimized to produce goods designed elsewhere. In software development a code factory shouldn't be 
confused with a sweat shop; it's not about the number of hours per day spent coding. How do you know if you work in 
a code factory?

1. **You don't know reasons** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Backdoor bottom-up ideas** - developer ideas are snuck in skunk works, hidden inside top-down projects or churned
out in hack-a-thons. There may even be a lot of code produced this way but all without the support of front door 
process, tools and reward mechanisms.
3. **Lots of fire fighting and poor infrastructure** - solving immediate problems is seen as more valuable than 
preventing future ones since no trust required.
4. **Gold plated external ideas and over customization** - big customer asks and legal requirements from outside the 
organization are especially shiny even if nobody really wants them. <br/><br/>APIs are much looser and configuration much more 
complex than they should be because detailed analysis doesn't come top down.
5. **Crappy project management** - Out of the box methodology and report heavy tools are frequently chosen by external 
trends and top-down choice.
6. **Deadline theater and fake MVPs** - top-down projects have hard deadlines that are then usually pushed. Its more 
about taking the decision of being done away from developers. <br/><br/>MVP is the least work necessary to get further feedback 
but code factory MVPs are really about trying to push the decision-making onto customers. 
Unfortunately, "This is crap." is not useful feedback.
7. **Fungible developers and pseudo teams** - developer decision-making muscle and domain knowledge stays under-developed 
or becomes atrophied so everyone is equally replaceable. <br/><br/>You may work on a team but the only opinion that
matters to you is your manager, team lead, product manager or chief architect - depending on the situation.
8. **Developer career paths limited** - code factories don't offer many paths forward for developers unless they become 
managers.
9. **Skills are not transferable** - code factories typically have their own way of doing things that's out of
touch with the latest technology and methodologies. How out of touch depends on how long the code factory has been 
operating.
10. **High risk of burnout even if comfortable** - your code factory might have a great or fully remote environment,
pay well and have friendly management. For many developers, long term none of that will matter unless they feel 
validation that they are making a difference.

This last point is where code factories are especially destructive. The fewer people involved in decision-making the
less chance of delighting customers. The more extraordinary effort required to innovate the less likely it is to happen.

Suppose you do work in a code factory though? Now what? We'll explore that question in our next blog.
