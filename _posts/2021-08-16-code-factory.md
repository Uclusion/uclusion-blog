In this series we explore more hierarchical environments, starting with what we call the "code factory".

Factories are optimized to produce goods designed elsewhere. In software development a code factory shouldn't be 
confused with a sweat shop; it's not about the number of hours per day spent coding. How do you know if you work in 
a code factory?

1. **Unexplained reasons** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Trouble changing things** - developer ideas maybe snuck in skunk works, hidden inside top-down projects or 
churned out in hack-a-thons but eventually this causes a very high technical debt load.
3. **Top-down organized** - Inflexible methodology, report heavy tools and forcibly assigned projects are common. You 
may work on a team but the only opinion that matters to you is your manager, team lead, product manager or 
chief architect - depending on the situation.
4. **Meaningless deadlines** - top-down projects have hard deadlines that are then usually pushed. The deadline theater
is more about taking design choices away from developers that would prefer not to add more technical debt.
5. **Limited career paths and gangs** - code factories don't offer many paths forward for developers unless 
they become managers. <br/><br/>Since there are reduced opportunities to prove yourself, relationships based on 
reporting structure and proximity play a larger role.
6. **Atrophied skills** - code factories typically have their own way of doing things that's out of
touch with the latest technology and methodologies. Plus your decision-making muscle and domain knowledge stays 
under-developed.

All six attributes of code factories stem from a single culture decision that developers perform better when 
spoon-fed as much instruction as possible. That engineering autonomy should be limited whenever possible like 
the automation that runs a factory.

Implicit in the code factory view of the world is that what is most valuable is the code produced, the 
customers gained and the money raised. An organization that instead prizes the team and culture its built might 
think nothing of re-writing entire sections of their code base or innovations designed for new markets.

>**The longer it takes to write code the more likely management will view the code, and not the team, as what is valuable.**

Here's where things get interesting though - the converse is also true. The longer it takes to write code the more 
likely management will view the code, and not the team, as what is valuable. So unless you're on a team of select
PHds cracking a nearly unsolvable puzzle, using the tools and methodology that helps you build the best, fastest is 
vital to avoiding collapsing into a code factory.

So is code factory a condition that can be overcome? We'll explore that question in our next blog.
