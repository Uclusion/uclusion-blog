Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when directed as much as possible.

 A code factory  shouldn't be confused with a sweat shop; it's not about the number of hours per day spent coding. Factory work might
even be superficially pleasant but this environment limits you from reaching your full potential.

## How do you know if you work in a code factory?

1. **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Rubber stamping** - Ideas from "above" are presented without alternatives, or opportunity for input.
3. **Meaningless deadlines** - projects have unexplained hard deadlines.
4. **Limited career paths** - shifting roles or positions is difficult and discouraged (or at best unrewarded).
5. **Cliques** - relationships are primarily based on reporting structure vs assigned areas.
6. **Non-portable skills** - code factories typically have their own way of doing things that's out of
touch with the latest technology and methodologies. Domain expertise and decision making skills atrophy.

## Why do code factories happen?

Code factories generally form because the higher levels of the organization believe that the engineering team lacks the
skills to handle the job on their own. Frequently this arises from founders transitioning into management (I know my code the best).

Or, the team may be having problems meeting deadlines to technical debt and a new manager is brought in to "clean things up".
>**The longer it takes to make progress the more likely management things the team needs "fixing"**

Unfortunately, once the spoon-feeding begins, it's very difficult to stop, and eventually the organization is entirely structured around it.

## What can you do if you're in a code factory?

Assuming you want autonomy over your day to day work, then you've basically got two options:

###Leave
Honestly it's usually easier to change roles than the dynamics of the team you're on.

### Start slowly changing things
Whoever runs the show is going to need convincing that the team is capable of operating by itself. The best way to prove *that*
is by doing, so start by getting your team to take over roles done by the factory boss.
For example:
1. Start asking about priorities and *why* they are a priority, and start taking over subtasking.
2. Get invited to the closed door meetings and bring what you learn back to your team.
3. Ask for more information on deadlines and help via proactive communication on status.
4. Bring in others *not on your team* to make sure information isn't siloed.

In the end more autonomy requires more work. Unless you want to be the new foreman, your team will have to rely on collaboration and 
communication to replace the dictates from on high.
