Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when directed as much as possible.
Unfortunately this severely limits the opportunity to grow in their career and can limit future prospects.

Unlike sweatshops, however, they may be perfectly pleasant places to work, but they do share these attributes:
## How do you know if you work in a code factory?
1. **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Rubber stamping** - ideas from "above" are presented without alternatives, or opportunity for input.
3. **Emphasis on getting 'done'** - projects have unexplained hard deadlines and no room for feedback loops.
4. **Limited cross-functional engagement** - teams are not encouraged to work together to find solutions, but instead just complete their tasks 

## How to escape?
Well, the first option is to leave and seek employment elsewhere.
Assuming you don't want to do that, then you're going to have to prove the team is 
capable of executing quickly and efficiently by itself.
To accomplish you're number one priority should be to:

## Reclaim wasted time
History has shown time and time again (e.g. Instagram) that a good team not wasting time pushing a rock up a hill
can produce amazing things.

These rocks tend to come in three categories: bloated and ineffective process, poor prioritization, and technical debt.
**By far the most impact can be had by fixing process**, because bad process _causes_ poor prioritization, and techinical debt
by forcing developers to spend time on things with low return, and forcing them to take shortcuts by eating up all available time.

In other words, if you want to stop working in a code factory, you have to adopt a fast, efficient process, and start executing efficiently.
