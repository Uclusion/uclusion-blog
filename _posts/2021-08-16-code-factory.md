Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when directed as much as possible.

They might not be sweatshops but the spoon-feeding severely limits your prospects. First, developers are not trusted 
enough to change architecture, so you will need a side gig to even _try_ to keep current skills. 

Second, code factories limit collaboration and leadership and make achieving any position of _real_ 
responsibility difficult. (Code factory management is just baby-sitting.)

excellence wonâ€™t be enough."

## How do you know if you work in a code factory?
* **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, everything need to know etc.
* **Rubber stamping** - ideas from "above" are presented without alternatives.
* **Getting 'done'** - unexplained hard deadlines and no room for feedback loops.
* **Limited teamwork** - developers do not engage much with their peers.

If your work has any of these then read on. Otherwise check out

## How to find a job outside a code factory
There are plenty of organizations that show signs of being better than code factory:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="padding-right: 3rem">Company</th>
      <th>Bottom up example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Google</td>
      <td>20% time policy leads to many new products</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Amazon</td>
      <td>Bottom up New Product Introduction process resulted in AWS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Apple</td>
      <td>iPhone started as a skunkworks project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Facebook</td>
      <td>Embraces open source</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Netflix</td>
      <td>Freedom and responsibility culture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spotify</td>
      <td>Emphasis on team autonomy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Slack</td>
      <td>Chat started as an internal tool and Salesforce 
<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/08/agile-methodology-salesforce-inside-look">sounds agile</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Instagram</td>
      <td>Thirteen person company when acquired by Facebook</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br />
However, if you decide to leave, there is no simple set of signs like "agile process", remote work or managers that code 
that guarantees avoiding code factory. Investigate the team you are interviewing with:
* Do teams ever detour from "paved road" centralized architecture?
* Do PMs make suggestions or give commands?
* Are engineering teams siloed by function?
* Does the management come from companies with a reputation for flexibility?
* How aligned is their tech stack with the latest technology?

It's important to wait for the right fit. Working for consecutive code factories won't help!

## What if you are a team lead or manager?
Code factories are stressful for their leaders since there is so little decision-making support and a general lack
of energy. You probably have to leave anyway, but the experience you can gain from trying to change things is worth it.

**By far the most impact can be had by fixing process**, because bad process _causes_ developers to spend time on 
things with low return. That in turn makes old technical debt remain, which eats up available time, which forces even 
more shortcuts.

You don't have to fix all of your process at once. Perhaps you already have a meeting like a retro or a hack-a-thon 
whose time can be reclaimed with something more effective.

Some suggestions for the new process:
1. Truly continuous so that whenever you have time, you work asynchronously.
2. Team and stakeholder opinions on any stories ROI should be visible.
3. The project management tool works _for you_. Instagram famously ran from tasks listed in a single elaborate
Google Doc, but hopefully you can do better.
4. The new process can run in parallel but could be extended to all work.

## Good luck
It's a big step so let's review why going beyond code factory is necessary. 

{% include callout.html

Here's an excerpt from a Netflix senior software engineer position:
>* Work closely with our customers & partners, understand their use cases & needs, think strategically to seek the right problem to solve at the right time, and innovate with rigor.
* Collaborate with the team to be responsible for the entire software lifecycle.
* Work on, collaborate with, and influence the open-source community, and have an impact in the industry.

Solving problems outside a code factory spoon-fed process gives you the skills you need to get to another level. Plus 
your employer could use the help!
