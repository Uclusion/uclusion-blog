Code factories grow from a belief that developers perform better when directed as much as possible.

They might not be sweatshops but the spoon-feeding severely limits career growth and future prospects. First, code 
factories tend to be on older technology since developers are not trusted enough to change architecture or re-write. So 
long term if you want to remain employable as a software developer and stay at a code factory, you will need a side gig. 

Second, code factories limit collaboration and leadership skills. That makes achieving any position of _real_ 
responsibility much harder. (You can become management within the code factory but that's just baby-sitting.)

## How do you know if you work in a code factory?
1. **Coding in the dark** - limited access to customers, closed door meetings, everything need to know etc.
2. **Rubber stamping** - ideas from "above" are presented without alternatives, or opportunity for input.
3. **Emphasis on getting 'done'** - projects have unexplained hard deadlines and no room for feedback loops.
4. **Limited teamwork** - developers do not engage much with their peers.

If you see any of 1 through 4 where you work then read on.

## How to find a job that's not a code factory
Top-down is not the only way corporate software development works so greener pastures are possible. For example:

| Company     |  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bottom up example |
| --- | --- |
| Google      | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20% time policy leads to many new products |
| Amazon      | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bottom up New Product Introduction process resulted in AWS |
| Apple       | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iPhone started as a skunkworks project |
| Facebook    | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Embraces open source |
| Netflix     | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Freedom and responsibility culture |
| Spotify     | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Emphasis on team autonomy |
| Slack       | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their group chat began as an internal tool |
| Instagram   | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thirteen person company when acquired by Facebook |

However, if you decide to leave, identifying the level of code factory of a team during the interview process 
is tricky. A company having an "agile process", remote work or managers that code doesn't say anything about code 
factory. Here are some questions you can ask:
* Who chooses the software development process? Similarly are teams allowed detours from the "paved road" 
architecture or is infrastructure centralized?
* How much power do PMs have? Engineering effectively reporting to a small group responsible for all idea generation 
is different from PMs making suggestions.
* Are engineering teams siloed by location or function? Do they have a sustaining team dedicated to technical debt? 
Either might mean development teams lack the autonomy to manage their architecture and quality.
* Does the management come from companies with a reputation for flexibility? The culture of previous jobs frequently 
influences the level of autonomy they encourage.
* How aligned is their tech stack with the latest technology? Code factories tend not to update.

Even if you are job seeking, its best if finding a new position is not your only angle on escaping code factory.

## How to make your current position tenable
Assuming you don't want leaving to be your only option, then you're going to need a team that is capable of executing 
quickly and efficiently by itself. To accomplish that without working yourself to death, you and your team will have to 
make full use of the time available to you.

Many code factory teams have the skills to succeed but are wasting time pushing rocks up a hill. These rocks tend to 
come in three categories: bloated and ineffective process, poor prioritization, and technical debt. 

**By far the most impact can be had by fixing process**, because bad process _causes_ developers to spend time on 
things with low return. That in turn makes old technical debt remain, and eats up available time which forces even more 
shortcuts.

Code factories frequently orphan technical debt and that makes it a great place to start. Perhaps you already have
a meeting like a retro or a hack-a-thon whose time can be reclaimed with something more effective.

Some suggestions for the new process:
1. It should be truly continuous - not reliant on "Sprints" or periodic meetings and events. That doesn't mean you 
will be able to contribute to it all the time; just that whenever you have time, you can work on it asynchronously.
2. It should record ROI-centric approvals. IE you should be able to see your team and stakeholder opinions.
3. Pick project management tools that work for you. Instagram famously ran from tasks listed in a single elaborate
Google Doc, but hopefully you can do better.
4. The new process should be eventually extendable to all the team's work.

Either your team will have a new and better way of doing some things, or you'll know exactly where your organization
stands on developer autonomy.

## Good luck
It's a big step so let's back up again and review why going beyond code factory is necessary. Here's an excerpt from
a Netflix senior software engineer position:
>* Work closely with our customers & partners, understand their use cases & needs, think strategically to seek the right problem to solve at the right time, and innovate with rigor.
* Collaborate with the team to be responsible for the entire software lifecycle.
* Work on, collaborate with, and influence the open-source community, and have an impact in the industry.

Self-organizing with your team to solve problems outside of code factory spoon-fed process and requirements includes
all the skills you need to get to another level. Plus your employer could use the help!
