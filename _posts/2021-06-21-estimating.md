If you want an estimate then pay for it.

In fact many plumbers would have me pay a charge even for coming out. But
even the one's that don't aren't going to give you an estimate without going
under the house first.

Estimating is work. The no sunken costs, no risk estimate is with high
probability just flat wrong.

The better an estimate you want the more you have to pay. #NoEstimates is 
too extreme but you need to drip fund your way to any estimate that might
be worth something. 

Maybe that involves a PoC but for most story estimating it means starting on a
story first and only estimating once you have enough information.

### Story points voted in a meeting
Free estimates don't build on each other. If I call 5 plumbers to 
get an estimate sight unseen, they might all agree, but it doesn't make
that estimate any more valid.

Nor does a meeting give you anywhere near enough time and concentration to 
do the work to generate more than the free estimate.

### "Spike" stories
Frequently teams will use "spike" stories to get enough information that the 
story can then be estimated in the next meeting.

Spike stories are a bad practice. They are drip funding without having fully
discussing the story's value.

Much better to actually start a story based on its value and see how it goes 
then to muddy the waters with nebulous further research.

### Project level estimates
Again you get what you pay for. If you need an accurate project level estimate
then first go waterfall and specify absolutely everything ahead of time. Even 
then there will be unknowns in implementation but at least one dimension
will be nailed down. 

If you can live with a back of the envelope estimate then use that but be clear
with yourself that you are mostly really just drip funding. There will be more 
information later and your investment strategy in the project might have to 
change.

### Status with revised project level estimates
The really naive strategy is to create a backlog that represents the entire 
project, put estimates on the whole backlog and then sum those estimates. Then 
as stories complete try to use the information about how long those
stories took to revise the project level estimate.

That's certainly a very expensive way to estimate but also unlikely to get you 
a more accurate date. The problem is that each of your story estimates is more
independent than you think. Or put another way, in software development, 
counting ten white swans doesn't make the probability less that the next swan 
is black.

In fact, it's even worse than that because software developers would tend
to start with the stories with which they are most comfortable. And even if 
you start with the hardest story first implementation might use a simple
approach that won't hold up later.

### What about #NoEstimates?
Once the true cost of an accurate estimate is taken into account a team
may well decide the ROI is just not there. Drip funding the project might
well be less risk then investing in estimates.

Or the team could decide that a very inexpensive estimation like number
of features completed / number of features remaining is good enough for their
purposes. So long as everyone is aware of the level of uncertainty then
it doesn't violate the principal of #NoEasyEstimates.

The most important is not to get fooled into believing you've earned 
knowledge of the future by making simple guesses.
