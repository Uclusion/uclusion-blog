Your agile team has learned to avoid large backlogs and guesstimates but you still
worry about delivering value.

So maybe you've started up a spreadsheet to vote on priorities or have some 
planning meeting. We believe you must do much better than that.

### Funding Process
Building software is a series of decisions about investments. Whether your team is deciding on a 
new initiative or whether to begin a story your process should be the same and meet some basic 
requirements:
* Everything associated with the decision should be online and visible to the team
* Each person's opinion should be fully captured - certainty, budget and reason
* Investments are point in time - you start or not
* Decisions made independently - either this is a good idea or not. How the idea ranks against
other ideas doesn't matter. We're not funding a mediocre idea just because it's surrounded by worse ones.

#### Online and visible
Meetings are not a reasonable way to make these decisions. Imagine you were asked to create your
stock portfolio in a meeting. Investments are too complex to be decided under meeting conditions.

Visibility is equally important for investments. Anyone on the team needs to be able to go back
at any time and see why this initiative or story made the cut.

#### Certainty, budget and reason
It's amazing how many, even large, projects or stories kick off without anyone answering these simple 
questions.

*How certain are you that this should be done?*

*How much time, upper bound, can we spend on this before it's not worth doing?*

*What's your reason for your certainty?*

All of these questions are vital for the motivation of a team or individual working on the project or 
story. 

If certainty is low maybe this shouldn't be done. If it is done the people doing it know to check back 
frequently if any issues arise.

The reasoning behind the certainty is equally vital to feeling a sense of accomplishment.

Don't worry that sharing an upper time bound will be misused. It's crucial for knowing whether to start 
a story or not and for thinking about different implementations. As with all investments there has to be 
monitoring anyway whether you share a budget or not.

#### Investments are point in time

It's important there be a cliff beyond which certainty, budget and reason opinions expire - use it or 
lose it. A good system will have reminders about this cliff built-in, and the opinion can be extended if
it's creator still believes.

#### Decisions made independently
Going back to the stock portfolio example you wouldn't invest in a stock with poor earnings just
because other stock's on a list had worse earnings. Unfortunately that's frequently what happens with 
prioritizing exercises, the top priorities seem like good choices just because of their relative standing.

This same problems occurs when bundling investments in some way (for fun search on 2008 crisis bundling).
So if you bundle project or story decisions inside releases or sprints, it becomes much easier for 
software that delivers less value to hide.

### After Funding

The initial investment decision is only the beginning of insuring you deliver value. We have
more blogs about the rest of the process and of course all of this is embodied in Uclusion - the tool
for agile project management without all the meetings.
