Status meetings have to go and its been long, long over due. But status meetings are just a symptom of the larger 
problem - **no meeting should be scheduled that hasn't been attempted asynchronously first**.

If you try to do the meeting asynchronously first you get a multitude of benefits:
1. You might not have to have the synchronous version and that will leave room for other meetings like socializing
1. You are guaranteed something is written down and if you have to have the synchronous version you can just update it
1. Chances of deeper thought going into decisions are greater
1. Chances of someone going unheard are greatly reduced as all opinions are written

Initial development ceremonies need to move into agile software. What should be scheduled instead are follow ups. For instance 
if you do a daily standup the first question should be, "Is there anything we need to discuss that wasn't resolved 
online?" If the answer is no then you've got more time for team discussions of whatever's interesting. If the answer 
is yes then you can have the in depth conversation that normally gets thrown into the "parking lot".

Healthy asynchronous collaboration will likely ultimately result in more instead of less synchronous conversation as 
one way information transfers and simple planning is replaced with talk about real innovation. Imagine coming to a 
retrospective with an already agreed initiative and the meeting is about implementation contention.

### Isn't asynchronous collaboration more difficult?

Many times the information necessary for asynchronous collaboration is already being written down - just scattered 
across group chat, issue trackers, wiki, etc. Other times everything is there but the system it is written in has 
no ability to record opinions. Putting it all together means using agile software designed specifically for 
collaboration.

### Doesn't our agile process specify the exact ceremonies?

*No credible agile process exactly specifies the ceremones*. For instance, for the daily standup, scrumguides.org says 
this, `The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses 
on progress toward the Sprint Goal.` If you are stuck on an island with a conch shell as the only technology then by 
all means pass the shell. If better technology is available then you should avail yourself of it.
