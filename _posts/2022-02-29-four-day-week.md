Whether you are joining the growing number of companies moving to 4-day work weeks, just want
a lighter Friday, or are already at 4 days and want to do better than Jira, Slack and Scrum,
increasing your pipeline of agreed upon work without increasing meetings is your objective.

**TL;DR**: signup for [Uclusion](https://uclusion.com) and immediately be put into a sandbox demo (a very small sample shown below)
with a team doing just that.

## Job approval
A job in Uclusion is an assignable description of work and after assignment the team receives inbox notification to 
approve or block.

  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/approval.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video class="vid-mobile" width="340" height="600" muted loop controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/approvalMobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

An approved job can be started without a meeting and the approvals eventually automatically expire if the job is not 
started.

## Job clarification
Jobs with approval may need team input on questions or implementation ideas. That input comes 
by creating a question or suggestion inside the job.

  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/voteQuestion.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/voteQuestionMobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

This inbox notification also automatically goes away if the question or suggestion is resolved.

## Status without meetings
When a job assignee opens a question, suggestion, or blocker in his job the job automatically
moves to Assistance Needed.

<video class="vid" width="1200" height="600" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swimlanes.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video class="vid-mobile" width="340" height="600" muted loop controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swimlanesMobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
So the Uclusion swimlanes show status at a glance that an ordinary board cannot.

## Uclusion inbox organized
The For You tab of the Uclusion inbox keeps track of all your action items and each item opens
to a wizard for handling it. Notifications self-destruct when no longer needed and your flow is also
preserved because each item contains all the context you need to process it.

The From You tab shows you all outstanding input you need from others and allows you to poke.

With this notification system a number of other out-of-the-box flows are supported including self assigning bugs, 
self assigning ready to start jobs, group question and suggestion discussion, job completion estimate update, and reply
handling.

## Feedback without meetings
When you open a progress report in Uclusion, the notification prompts teammates for review:

<video class="vid" width="1200" height="600" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/review.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video class="vid-mobile" width="340" height="600" muted loop controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/reviewMobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Instead of review, you can also change the estimated completion date and the team will see the new estimate.

**We hope you will consider [Uclusion](https://uclusion.com) and enjoy dozens more features like above.**
