Organizing software engineering is hard. Even successful organizations like 
[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/scaling-engineering-org) struggle.

We humbly suggest that, if you are a software developer on a team that holds traditional retrospectives, 
this mess is partially on you. You have a mandate to continuously improve, and your team hasn't adopted the tools, 
process or mindset to make it happen.

Otherwise, why are you still painfully sitting through retrospectives that probably go nowhere!

Here's why they go nowhere:
1. Anything prioritized with feature stories will lose. Like Google's famous 
   [20% project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project), you need this work on its own track.
2. No meeting filled process is going to cut it for continuous improvement.

## A Fast Track for Technical Debt and Innovation
Not _all_ decisions can be made top down; it simply doesn't scale. That's why VCs loosely couple with startups, 
large organizations like the 
[US Army](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwruSHBhAtEiwA_qCpprh9En4ltV31tCE_uoO2WjsJud2Jj977DyzugST2iG2aPOd5svWejhoC7FYQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241895014260&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9032183&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=7887596021403679128&hvtargid=kwd-79779609946&hydadcr=22532_10344436&keywords=team+of+teams&qid=1626958316&sr=8-1)
and [Amazon engineering](https://medium.com/swlh/working-at-amazon-software-engineer-4d491f2d0f7e) prize leadership,
and the reason retrospectives exist.

You absolutely can build a new product top down but **improving it requires more than feature factories**. In many 
organizations this means a single engineer, skunk works style, does the heavy lifting for technical debt, or a team
does innovation in a hackathon.

These extraordinary efforts will achieve improvement but not _continuous_ improvement. For continuous improvement,
you need some effort outside feature factory project management all the time, sustainably.

## What about the Boss?
If you are the boss then we recommend dropping 
[meeting driven process](({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2021/07/07/face-to-face.html)) for all the team's work. If you are
not the boss then we recommend starting by replacing retrospectives with something that works. Here's how you negotiate
that:
* Scrum recommends a `three hours for a one-month Sprint` retrospective. That's basically a work day (who codes after
  a three hour meeting?) and let's conservatively throw in another day for whatever was supposed to come out of that 
  meeting.
* Ask to drop retrospectives but allow people 2 days a month (one day a two-week Sprint) for improvement as they see 
  fit.

## Pick the Tools and Process that Work
You're looking for a process and tools for initiative approval and organizing work among a group of peers. You may 
have meetings from time to time, but your project management tool should be designed to work without them as much as 
possible. 

Good luck! We at Uclusion are rooting for you (and we've spent years bootstrapping a tool to help you into existence).
