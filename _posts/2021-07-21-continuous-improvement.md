Your team needs to drop retrospective meetings and use that time for self-organized improvement.

To make that work your project management / communications tool must help avoid meeting overhead.

**That's the recommendation and now let's back up and see why.**

Not _all_ decisions can be made top-down; it simply doesn't scale. That's why VCs loosely couple with startups,
large organizations like the
[US Army](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwruSHBhAtEiwA_qCpprh9En4ltV31tCE_uoO2WjsJud2Jj977DyzugST2iG2aPOd5svWejhoC7FYQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241895014260&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9032183&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=7887596021403679128&hvtargid=kwd-79779609946&hydadcr=22532_10344436&keywords=team+of+teams&qid=1626958316&sr=8-1)
and [Amazon engineering](https://medium.com/swlh/working-at-amazon-software-engineer-4d491f2d0f7e) prize leadership,
and the reason [retrospectives exist]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2021/06/29/planning.html).

In many organizations this decision gap leads to occasional extraordinary efforts: a single engineer, skunk works style,
does some heavy lifting for technical debt, there's a 'tech debt month', or a team does innovation in a hackathon.

The problem with extraordinary efforts is that they are difficult to incorporate in an organization's reward structure.
There's your job and then there are these rare events outside regular process.

## Why Retrospective Meetings Don't Work
1. Anything prioritized with top-down initiatives such as feature stories will lose. Like Google's famous
   [20% project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project), you need this work on its own track.
2. The retrospective becomes top-down itself and takes away the available time for a different track.

Mandatory meetings don't result in self-organized work as we explain in
[another blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2021/07/07/face-to-face.html). You can make self-organizing a principle of your 
organization but mandating _how_ to self-organize is like telling people who to vote for to promote democracy! Few 
people feel responsibility for the results of a process forced on them.

## Failing to Improve matters
Even [successful organizations](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/scaling-engineering-org) struggle to organize software 
engineering - causing ordinary developers stress and career damage. 

John Cutlefish's description of a [feature factory](https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory) 
is very accurate. Though the tools for data driven decisions that his employer sells won't get you to 
continuous improvement by themselves. You need more than data to make technical debt decisions and innovation by 
throwing everything at the wall takes too long.

What John doesn't mention is that feature factories leave developers in an untenable situation. **They work harder 
and harder but can't move the needle forward on their product and so ultimately are blamed for failure.**

Wrestling control away from PMs and giving the keys to the kingdom to engineering likely gets the flip side of 
feature factories, gold-plated infrastructure. Here the engineering team builds wonderfully ingenious architectures 
that don't really serve much purpose. We've all seen them - libraries built ignoring open source, fail over strategies
to solve end of the world events, or seven layers of caching to solve a non-existent performance problem.

What feature factories and gold-plating have in common is that they are based on the ideas of the few approved without 
much feedback.

## Pick the Tools and Process that Work
You're looking for a process and tools for initiative approval and organizing work among a group of peers. You may
have meetings from time to time, but your project management tool should be designed to make sure you don't waste
those meetings on overhead.

Good luck! We at Uclusion are rooting for you (and we've spent years bootstrapping a tool to help you into existence).
