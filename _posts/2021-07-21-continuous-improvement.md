Your team needs to drop retrospective meetings and use that time for self-organized improvement.

To make that work your project management / communications tool must help avoid meeting overhead.

**That's the recommendation and now let's back up and see why.**

Not _all_ decisions can be made top-down. That's why VCs loosely couple with startups,
large organizations like the
[US Army](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwruSHBhAtEiwA_qCpprh9En4ltV31tCE_uoO2WjsJud2Jj977DyzugST2iG2aPOd5svWejhoC7FYQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241895014260&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9032183&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=7887596021403679128&hvtargid=kwd-79779609946&hydadcr=22532_10344436&keywords=team+of+teams&qid=1626958316&sr=8-1)
and [Amazon engineering](https://medium.com/swlh/working-at-amazon-software-engineer-4d491f2d0f7e) prize leadership,
and the reason [retrospectives exist]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2021/06/29/planning.html).

In many organizations this decision gap leads to occasional extraordinary efforts: a single engineer, skunk works style,
does some heavy lifting for technical debt, there's a 'tech debt month', or a team does innovation in a hackathon.

The problem with extraordinary efforts is that they are difficult to incorporate in an organization's reward structure.
There's your job and then there are these rare events outside regular process.

## Why Retrospective Meetings Don't Work
1. Anything prioritized with top-down initiatives such as feature stories will lose. Like Google's famous
   [20% project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project), you need this work on its own track.
2. Making decisions by team meeting is too expensive for the limited time available. You need one meeting to set the 
agenda, a second to decide on priorities, a third to approve implementations, a fourth for review and a fifth to 
answer questions. 
3. Mandatory meetings don't result in self-organized work as we explain in
[another blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/agile/2021/07/07/face-to-face.html). You can make self-organizing a principle of your 
organization but mandating _how_ to self-organize is like telling people who to vote for to promote democracy!

## Why Too Much Top-Down is Stressful
Without self-organized improvement developers are left in an untenable situation. **They work harder
and harder but can't move the needle forward on their product and so ultimately are blamed for failure.**

You can read about that even in [profitable organizations](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/scaling-engineering-org). 
The result is frequently the
[feature factory](https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory) described by John Cutlefish. 
John's employer sells data driven decisions, but they don't solve the top-down decision-making problem.

Wrestling control away from PMs and giving the keys to the kingdom to engineering likely gets the flip side of 
feature factories, gold-plated infrastructure. Here the engineering team builds wonderfully ingenious architectures 
that don't really serve much purpose - libraries built ignoring open source, fail over strategies
to solve end of the world events, or seven layers of caching to solve a non-existent performance problem.

Gold-plating also fails to move the needle forward because people work on ideas that were never really vetted.

## Pick the Tools and Process that Work
You're looking for a process and tools for initiative approval and organizing work among a group of peers. You may
have meetings from time to time, but your project management tool should be designed to make sure you don't waste
those meetings on overhead and poorly defined agendas.

Good luck! We at Uclusion are rooting for you (and we've spent years bootstrapping a tool to help you into existence).
