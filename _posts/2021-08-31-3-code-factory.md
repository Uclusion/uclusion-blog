The more complex, long term, challenge, the less likely code factories will succeed and the more likely giving 
developers more responsibility will.

In agent-based system terms, [Escaping Code Factory]({{site.baseurl}}/agile/2021/08/16/code-factory.html) and 
[Preventing Code Factory]({{site.baseurl}}/agile/2021/08/28/2-code-factory.html) established that going beyond code
factory means [deliberative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_agent) developers. There are many ways to 
establish such a system, so we will just discuss the most obvious one.

## Less coerced work
If you have customers telling you exactly what to do then it's just a matter of passing that information down to the 
development teams. However, much of modern software development doesn't have that luxury.

Not because we are not "Lean" enough and this problem is as simple as polls plus MVPs. It's because software is
a very competitive industry and most simple solutions were already coded. Like any gold rush, later prospectors have
to go farther and use more sophisticated techniques.

So to stay competitive it's time for many employers to reduce forcing developer roles and projects. It just doesn't 
scale and less code factory like competition will prevail.

## Deliberative developers
Here's one way to accomplish less coercion:
* Developers work on the projects they choose, in the amount they choose, and are responsible for justifying their work
* Managers can temporarily draft developers for work with known ROI if no volunteers

**The key part is to not pay managers to do the wrong thing.** Telling developers exactly what to do at all times
needs to be removed from their job description. When they use their power of coercion for projects of unknown ROI,
it's _their risk_, not an expectation of their role. Their role becomes judging the value of what their developers did 
instead of ordering it ahead of time.

There are any number of senior developers already working mostly this way. There are also employers like Google where
every developer is responsible for justifying his promotion to a committee that's not his boss.

The code factory problem arises from the general degree of developer responsibility - not because developers are never 
given that kind of freedom.

## Guaranteed staffing is bad
Imagine a TV show where writers are guaranteed what they write will make it onto the show. That show will suck.

PMs and managers supporting their ideas have to have skin in the game. So if they want developers they should be 
forced to convince them the project will be successful. If they draft developers then it has to be at the risk
of their performance review showing they coerced employees into a failed project.

Furthermore, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a developer leaving a project that he no longer feels confident
about. So even once a project is staffed it should have to compete with other projects for resources. If a manager
feels strongly enough he can invoke the draft but not having enough volunteer support should put the projects 
funding in question.

This system is beyond what hack-a-thons or even 20% time systems can offer because you have to make the case for your 
productivity at all times. It will be much harder in this system to have an engineering team doing projects that won't 
ever generate revenue and that's exactly what is happening very frequently now.
