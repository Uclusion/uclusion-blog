The more complex, long term, challenge, the less likely code factories will succeed and the more likely giving 
developers more responsibility will.

In agent-based system terms, [Escaping Code Factory]({{site.baseurl}}/agile/2021/08/16/code-factory.html) and 
[Preventing Code Factory]({{site.baseurl}}/agile/2021/08/28/2-code-factory.html) established that going beyond code
factory means [deliberative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_agent) developers.

## Don't force low ROI work
If you have customers telling you exactly what to do then it's just a matter of passing that information down to the 
development teams. However, much of modern software development doesn't have that luxury.

Not because we are not "Lean" enough as this problem is not as simple as polls plus MVPs. It's because software is
a very competitive industry and most simple solutions were already coded. Like any gold rush, later prospectors have
to go farther and use more sophisticated techniques.

Here's one way to stop assigning low value jobs:
* Developers work on the projects they choose, in the amount they choose, and are responsible for justifying their work
* Managers can temporarily draft developers for work with known ROI if no volunteers

The manager's role becomes more judging the value of what their developers did instead of ordering it ahead of time.

There are any number of senior developers already working mostly this way. There are also employers like Google where
every developer is responsible for justifying his promotion to a committee that's not his boss.

## Guaranteed staffing is bad
Imagine a TV show where writers are guaranteed what they write will make it onto the show. That show will suck. Even 
once a project is staffed it should have to compete with other projects for its existing resources.

PMs have to have skin in the game. If they want staffing they should be forced to convince developers or convince 
managers to risk drafting.

This system is beyond what hack-a-thons or even 20% time systems can offer because you have to make the case for your 
productivity at all times.

## Check-ins are ridiculous
If you want to know your employees problems then use software which makes it clear. To answer questions
individuals may have just hold "office hours".

## Middle ground manager jobs are stupid
Here's an excerpt from a software development manager's job description:
>* Lead Agile processes across multiple teams that consistently deliver a quality product to customers
* Rally your team to make and keep commitments to customers, the business, and themselves
* Team up with your Product Owners and UX Designers in planning and preparing your teamsâ€™ backlog

Huh?!? It's an _agile_ team, not simple task based workers and not working on a simple product, but you are going to
somehow _lead_ them to _consistently_ deliver value. So do you make the commitments and force them on the team? No, you 
can only _rally_ them to commit themselves. Well in that case do you create the backlog? No, that's coming from Product
Owners and UX Designers.

**Look be code factory or be not code factory. There's no magical, ineffable middle ground that can be an
organization's goal.**

As a result of this ambiguity many managers start trying to create roles for themselves. They imagine they will 
replace HR by listening to whisper campaigns. Or they see their value add as preventing their employees from trying
to get work done that might rock the boat. Hard to blame them though when even their job description makes no sense.

## A beyond code factory manager job description
* Review your employees contributions to the projects they choose and spend team salary increase, stock and bonus 
accordingly
* Work with stake-holders to identify high ROI, understaffed work and temporarily draft your employees as necessary
* Take on coding projects yourself so that you can continue to have the skills to evaluate your team
