Python or Java, from the 1990s, are a reasonable part of today's software development. Both languages have plenty of 
competition and adapt through new releases.

Other old inventions, like Scrum, group chat, and Kanban boards have no place in modern software development.

Group chat started with IRC in 1988 and the human to human interaction (not alerts from integration APIs) 
hasn't changed other than unfurling, more emojis, and threads.

Kanban boards, the expansion of Jira beyond issue tracking, date back to 1970s Japanese factories and are 
also mostly unchanged:

Scrum was first implemented in 1993 and somehow remains constant despite game changers like cloud software and remote 
work.

## Team meetings rubber stamp
Creating software is too difficult to be in the hands of people taking little or no responsibility. Scrum says 
self-organization but then assigns each detail to a different manager.

However, even teams that break with Scrum to distribute responsibility still use the team meeting, a time-boxed 
collaboration cage match. The Scrum guide dictates that meetings be about consensus building - not ideation 
or hearing alternatives:

>The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

Maybe 1990s IT projects were simple enough for the person in contact with the single customer to, every cycle, by 
himself propose an idea that increases value of a product within two weeks. For modern software this is a ridiculous 
ask.

Once the planning meeting is over the standup, no matter how bloated beyond 15 minutes, cannot effectively course
correct. So comes feature factory, or more generally [code factory]({{site.baseurl}}/startup/2021/08/16/code-factory.html),
an endless creation of things that no customer ever uses while technical debt and basic stability are squandered.

Any team meeting must be about consensus building because that's what team meetings do. So 
retrospectives don't work because you can't fix meeting based process with more meetings. 

When JetBrains developers wanted off of Java's 1990s issues they had to invent Kotlin. If you want off of meeting
based process you need a better technology.

## Uclusion is better
Uclusion is an opinionated task management app that combines communication, collaboration, assignments, and status.

### Moves the needle
Coding the right thing, the right way is first priority so Uclusion notifies the team to add an approval with reason 
and certainty for each assignment. Once approved an assignment must get an estimate or automatically be moved back
to approval after a configurable number of days. If estimates change the team is alerted and if the assignment is past 
the estimated date for the configurable number of days, it again automatically moves back.

Plus anyone can open a blocking issue, question with voteable options, or suggestion with voting on any assignment at 
any time. Uclusion also includes workflows for asynchronously getting feedback, critical bug assignment, discussing 
backlog, and much more.

### Enables a maker's schedule
A [maker's schedule](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) has very few team meetings, not just because
you can't code in a group setting, but you also don't feel like coding before or after.

>When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.

Also with teams working across time zones, team meetings reduce the time available for one on one interactions.

### Real status at a glance
* If you don't capture collaboration then you lose track of what needs assistance, review, etc.

### Guided instead of chaos
* People write guides the size of books to try to control Slack
* Or spend years customizing Jira but still unable to get users to understand
* Or try to remake Scrum but then have neither Scrum literature nor software enforced rules

### Creates a more friendly culture
* At first remote work seemed like engineers against management, but eventually it became clear that the take
rate among managers is not that different from anyone else - culture is about tool adoption and although
some may prefer software development team meeting culture many will not - no matter what their role
* Otherwise senior engineers look to escape into pure back end work, architecture, and management


* But the fear of remote work was over blown. Corporations are better now with options and increasingly more of them
will not enforce 5 days a week in the office.
* Similarly Uclusion really just offers you more options - you can still do endless meetings or code things your
team has a low opinion of if you want to. Just relying solely on tools like meetings, Jira and Slack with no help for 
developer collaboration should stop for sure
* What happens if you choose the wrong tool for the job? Uclusion uses Python for it's backend instead of Java
and perhaps should have gone Javascript so that the front end and backend would be in more similar languages.
