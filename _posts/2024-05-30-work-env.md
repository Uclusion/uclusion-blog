There is some 1990s technology, like Python or Java, that reasonably continue to be a part of software development. 
They both have tons of competition and adapt through new releases.

However, there are other 1990s inventions whose popularity in modern software development makes no sense - Scrum,
the IRC inspired part of group chat, and Kanban boards are in this category. None of these over a quarter of a century
old tools have been significantly updated nor reasonably challenged by newer ways.

IRC originated in 1988 and the human to human part of group chat (not the machine integration APIs which are new) really 
hasn't changed much other than emojis and threads. Kanban boards actually date back to 1970s Japanese factories and
are also mostly unchanged:

However, even for engineering teams with complete freedom of choice, meetings are the dominate and only collaboration 
tool beyond code review and wiki. Remote work has finally made an inroad into software development environments but 
somehow Scrum like process remains unchallenged.

## The politics of Scrum
We are stuck in the 1990s until we admit we need full development team ownership. Some attempts have 
been made to break out responsibility by engineering level but the "with great power comes great 
responsibility" maxim falls apart when we, ala the movie Kick-Ass, restate it as "with little power comes little 
responsibility". That can't work as software is too fragile and too difficult to make useful to be in the hands of 
people taking little or no responsibility.

The [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) from 2001 is unable to come out and say that developer 
collaboration matters. "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools" - still allows and even encourages 
unlimited purposeless meetings and poor collaboration tools. It should have directly said "Engineering teams over 
top-down management" but admittedly someone marketing a collaboration tool will see that one differently than someone 
selling consulting and books.

Meanwhile, an industry like health care goes the other direction and nurses are more and more empowered because the 
health of the patient obviously depends on it. Yet software is basically health care for code and the code is more and 
more and more complex.

Certainly even Scrum is very aware of the problem and makes noise about self-organization but then proceeds
to surround a development team with a cloud of management. Typically, there is a manager, scrum master, and product 
owner super-imposed on the engineering process team lead, architect, and perhaps a council or two. Plus perhaps 
different managers for backend, UI, and AI work.

Then there are "sprints" to finish work quickly as if finishing just any work, instead of ROI, was the point. Imagine a 
sprint in health care - this patient must show visible improvement in 2 weeks or else - doesn't work for code either.

The team meeting though is the centerpiece of developer exclusion - a zero-sum, time-boxed, winner take all (since 
dissenting opinion not recorded), cage match to be heard except that the winner is already chosen. Scrum is very up 
front that its planning meeting be about consensus building - not ideation or hearing alternatives:

>The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

Even if you are Alexander the Great, perhaps the perfect product owner, there comes a time when you must listen to your 
army (Coenus was right about the risk of Alexander dying in India and the army floundering as Alexander died only 
three years later). 

For most product owners the time to listen more to the team is all the time - maybe 1990s IT projects were simple 
enough for a person in contact with customers to be sole lead but the complexity, number of moving parts, and number of 
customers on modern software is way beyond that structure.

Of course there is that cloud of managers around the engineering team and, in theory, any of them could stand up to 
a product owner insisting on invading India. In practice though paying an engineering manager to resolve conflicts
makes them very unlikely to start them; they will only step in after a team expresses enough disagreement.

So most teams have a daily scrum that is changed from 15 minutes to near endless in order to allow some collaboration 
but keeping everyone, interested or not, trapped in a meeting while some engineer pitches an idea is just not 
reasonable.

## Uclusion is better
* Make clear Uclusion is an app and opinionated

### Reduces feature factory
* Explain putting approval with level of certainty and reason is different from a rubber stamp meeting
* Allows developers to reverse the process and push their ideas in - maybe for a better feature but maybe for
technical debt
* Avoids real time problem with meetings

### Enables a maker's schedule

### Real status at a glance
* If you don't capture collaboration then you lose track of what needs assistance, review, etc.

### Guided instead of chaos



* But the fear of remote work was over blown. Corporations are better now with options and increasingly more of them
will not enforce 5 days a week in the office.
* Similarly Uclusion really just offers you more options - you can still do endless meetings or code things your
team has a low opinion of if you want to. Just relying solely on tools like meetings, Jira and Slack with no help for 
developer collaboration should stop for sure
* What happens if you choose the wrong tool for the job? Uclusion uses Python for it's backend instead of Java
and perhaps should have gone Javascript so that the front end and backend would be in more similar languages.
