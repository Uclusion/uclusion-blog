The idea behind autonomous teamwork is that employees are highly trained professionals
whose productivity depends on *being able to focus*.

## Accordingly any meetings or focus breaking communication should be used sparingly. 

The below table captures an example of autonomous teamwork applied to Scrum as defined by the 
[Scrum guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-planning). Their definition of product backlog is 
`an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.` For autonomous teamwork this list is maintained 
in the Workspace description. The Scrum guide also specifies that `Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the 
Product Owner as more is learned.` Autonomous teamwork story creation and approval is continuous so there is no 
emphasis on up front estimating other than choosing the Sprint Goal.

|  Event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |  Official Description | &nbsp;| Autonomous Teamwork Addition  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Planning - Topic one | The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |  The team will be aware of any Initiatives that were voted favorably and consider them while deciding the Sprint Goal. |
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |
| Planning - Topic two | Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.|  &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Backlog refinement already helped by Workspace level communication. Conclusions of any Workspace Dialogs are discussed. Detailed refinement discouraged. |
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |
| Planning - Topic three | For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done.|  &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Since story creation and approval happens continuously during development, discussion focuses on the Definition of Done as it applies to the Sprint Goal.  |
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |
|  Daily - 15 minute | The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. | &nbsp; &nbsp; | First discuss stories in Blocked and Requires Input. Then any story in Ready to Start that lacks approval. Then stories In Progress that are yellow missing a progress report or whose estimated completion date is past the Sprint Goal. Then any story In Progress or In Review with open Suggestions or TODOs if clarification required. |
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |
|  Daily - throughout day | The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work. |  &nbsp; &nbsp;  | In addition to having the continuous, asynchronous, software assisted form of the daily 15 minute, the team uses Dialogs and Questions with approvable options to help with implementation decisions.  |
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |
|  Review  | The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation. | &nbsp; &nbsp; | During the Sprint, when a story is placed In Review the team is alerted and gives feedback using Suggestions and TODOs. The Review focuses on accommodating opinions from outside the team. |
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |
|  Retrospective  | The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. | &nbsp; &nbsp; | The team will be aware of any Initiatives or Dialogs on improvement and consider ones with approval or approved options while deciding what changes to make. |
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; |

Meetings and messaging aren't going to go away, but the investment they represent can be better
spent on the problems that truly need it and with a context established to make everyone's opinion known before the 
meeting begins.
