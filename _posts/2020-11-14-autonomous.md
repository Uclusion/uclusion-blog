The idea behind autonomous teamwork is that employees are highly trained professionals
whose productivity depends on *being able to focus*.
Accordingly any meetings or focus breaking communication should be used as an absolute
last resort.

For this reason autonomous teamwork delegates the communication overhead of status, planning, implementation decisions
and new project ideas to software that understands the context.

As a simple example, if a team member raises a block issue on a story, the *software*, not a *human*
software must handle alerting the team, exposing the new status, and making sure that
progress is halted until the issue is resolved.

### Advancements in agile software can be described as advancements in understanding the need to focus

A similar approach is taken with implementation decisions. If an implementation question is asked about a story,
autonomous teamwork  requires adherent software to make it easy for everyone to know the options and who has approved
which option and why.
Let me emphasize this again: autonomous teamwork insists that *software handles coordination instead of
ensuring coordination via meeting*.

To avoid the need for up front planning meetings, autonomous teamwork asks each participant to begin working
on a story only if their team has voted on whether it should be taken. Furthermore, to assist the implementer
in maximizing delivered value, each voter is asked to provide their certainty, a reason behind their vote and an allowable
"budget" for doing the story. Ideally, each new story is approved *before* the current one is finished,
but in case it's not the software *must* alert the participant and team that the pool is running dry so they can fix it.

By making a best attempt at autonomous teamwork and intelligent software first, we
get most of the benefits of communication *and dedicated forcus time*. Meetings
and messaging isn't going to go away, but the investment they represent can be better
focused on the things that truly need it.
