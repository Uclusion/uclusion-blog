Colocation in an agile context means that all team members are in the same office.

Current agile is built on the assumption of colocation and this shows up
right in the 12 principles:
`The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.`

Scrum explicitly assumes colocation, because the most frequent activity
is a face-to-face meeting, the Standup. Kanban practictioners [sometimes choose](https://www.conjur.org/blog/running-a-kanban-standup-meeting) a daily meet also.

When the number of remote workers was few it was possible to ignore the problems of insisting on group meetings, but now the 
assumption that everyone shares a time zone, much less the same office, is difficult to make.

Colocation, in such an absolute form, isn't coming back either. Companies don't have to maintain an expensive
office, and can hire talent wherever they happen to live.
Employees don't have to commute, and have a much wider choice of employers. There will still be plenty of teams
able to use a scheduled group meeting but insisting on those meetings as the only way will no longer be reasonably flexible.

Even if you are a completely co-located team the next hire might be remote or the next project require collaboration with a team in
another time zone. To survive, agile is going to have to adapt, and use tools and flows that work
across geography and time zones.

Calling meetings by default has to go away and be replaced with smart software that
notifies the right people at the right times. Meetings will be held more strategically with the groundwork for the meeting
already taking place asynchronously.

Written communication will replace the face to face meetings scheduled as part of process, and structure will need
to be placed around that communication to keep the signal to noise ratio high.

Fortunately, agile is built on the principle of introspection and adaptation and
practitioners are well prepared to make the necessary changes.
