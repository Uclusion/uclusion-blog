The idea behind autonomous teamwork is to use meetings and mostly synchronous communication like group chat as a 
last resort. All the decisions and information necessary to make progress are entered in intelligent software
that alerts the team to help with a decision, approve a new story, collaborate on requirements, etc.

The reasoning is simple - we want to collaborate with others but we also want to stay focussed as much as 
possible. The more people that participate in meetings and messaging the less focus is possible.

So instead autonomous teamwork delegates the communication overhead of status, planning, implementation decisions 
and new project ideas to software that understands the context. As a simple example, if a blocking comment is 
opened on a story, the story is moved to "blocked" stage, the team is alerted and progress on the story halted.

### There is example after example of agile communication being handled better by a system that understands what is happening.

Of course the blocked example can be accomplished with meetings or messaging but the amount of concentration lost
by the team will be far greater. If an implementation question is asked about a story and there
are five options, autonomous teamwork will make it easy for everyone to know the options and who has approved 
which option and why. Doing that with meetings or messaging will take much, much longer - so long that
one might be tempted to just decide the implementation by himself.

The same applies to any team decision. If you need a story approved put it into "Ready to Start" and get
your team's certainty about whether it should be taken, their reason and their budget for doing it. If you
get your new story approved while you are working on another story then you won't be slowed down and people 
don't have to respond in an all at the same time meeting.

Meetings and messaging will happen anyway since not all communication can be
structured. **But if we don't make a best attempt at autonomous teamwork first then
we lose a lot of the benefits of collaboration as the team's work style becomes
forced towards synchronous and scheduled.**
