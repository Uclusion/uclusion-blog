Agile has become an excuse for endless meetings, and it's time to push back.

>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

It's okay to follow advice from a methodology that tells you software is complex, and you will need to listen to smart
people and be prepared to pivot. It's not okay for a methodology to prescribe specific communication tools like
exact meetings, Kanban boards or open office. Communication is going to vary by the technology available and has to be
approached like any other technology choice.

In my recent experience with having an explainer video made meetings were used only for brain-storming. The explainer 
video company had approval software that captured what was being approved and by whom and review software that allowed 
you to comment frame by frame in a story board or video.

None of this software was available 20 years ago when the agile manifesto was written, and we don't read 20-year-old 
reviews to determine our editor or build tools.

### Two bowls of porridge
My entire software developer career I've seen two approaches - endless meetings or working alone. When developer 
process doesn't involve customers, like open source or the IETF, things look radically different. As soon as status
and release dates are on the table, reasonable collaboration seems off the table.

That's not the case for similar collaborations like the video process above, designers and Figma or 
InVision like tools, and any number of business processes. So why are software developers still doing communication 
much the same way as thirty years ago?

There's a clue in Martin Fowler's [article on CI/CD](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) 
from 2006:
>When I've described this practice to people, I commonly find two reactions: "it can't work (here)" and 
"doing it won't make much difference". What people find out as they try it is that it's much easier than it sounds, 
and that it makes a huge difference to development. Thus the third common reaction is "yes we do that - how could you 
live without it?"

The software industry is frequently too busy to adapt process. When I was first introduced to Scrum 15 years ago I 
thought "Wow, we're trying something new!" But I would not see another commonly adopted change to developer
communication until Covid forced remote work mainstream.

### Meeting all the time is too hot
Collaboration determines what we work on next and how we implement what we are working on now so there cannot be a more
important process. Let's take as many meetings as necessary! In fact let's use an open floor plan to encourage one 
continuous meeting all the time; nearly every introduction of Scrum I witnessed was closely followed by open offices.

And I get the logic - it's at least consistent. But now that almost everyone realizes the issues with an all day 
meeting environment, it's time to also see the limitations of meetings as a software developer communication tool.

You can't afford to have meetings all the time and, in an agile environment, you also can't afford to have your
approvals, questions and reviews wait for the next meeting. So if meetings are your only tool then your development 
process comes down to put up with open office like constant interruptions or suffer regularly doing the wrong thing or 
the wrong way.

### Working by yourself is too cold
There is a class of problems that can be solved with limited interaction with others. Let's call 
them *yesterday's problems*. Yesterday's problems have fairly obvious solutions and if you need extra hands for the 
grunt work you can employ a [code factory]({{site.baseurl}}/agile/2021/08/16/code-factory.html) process.

Plus there is a straightforward technique to guarantee a large supply of yesterday's problems. On the
infrastructure side just pile up technical debt. On the feature side just let your competition do all the innovation.

However, for fixing today's problems minimal collaboration is a disaster. Even if you are the product
manager or chief architect new problems are too complex to take on without a lot of guiding opinions.

### A third bowl
Once we admit we're facing a "just right" kind of choice, we know off the shelf solutions won't work. If
you are not willing to experiment with software methodology then you will end up with a lot of cold oatmeal and burnt
tongues.

So how do we go about making the right communication tool choices? For instance if we are not allowed to quote process
scripture then the choice of in office participation is daunting. Nor does watching papa and mama bear big companies 
communications decisions necessarily tell you what is right for you.

The same goes for collecting status - there are traditional meetings, bots that simulate meetings and software that
goes beyond meetings. The same plethora of solutions applies to continuous improvement, planning, feedback and helping
communications tools.

However, I think that our industry has overall over-estimated the cost of process experimentation. My previous employer
starting experimenting with remote work long before the pandemic. The cost of experimentation is much lower than 
normally assumed and the cost of not experimenting is much, much higher than most think.

Like Goldilocks we have to find quick ways to try potential solutions. Otherwise we will not only be eating the wrong
porridge but sitting in the wrong chair and sleeping in the wrong bed as well.
