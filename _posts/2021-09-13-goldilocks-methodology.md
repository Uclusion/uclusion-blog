These quotes have become an excuse for endless meetings, and it's time to push back.

>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Let's take the example of getting an explainer video made. Our experience was that meetings were used only for 
brain-storming. For approval and review the explainer video company had specific software. The approval software 
captured what was being approved and by whom - so that anyone can see afterwards. The review software allowed you to 
comment frame by frame in a story board or video.

None of this software was available 20 years ago when the agile manifesto was written. Nor do we apply this kind of 
thinking to any of our other tools selection. We certainly don't read 20-year-old reviews to determine our editor
or build tools.

### Why we've settled for the wrong bowl of porridge
My entire software developer career I've seen two approaches - endless meetings or working alone. When developer 
process doesn't involve customers, like open source or the IETF, things look radically different. As soon as status
and release dates are on the table, reasonable collaboration seems off the table.

That's not the case for similar collaborations like the video process above, designers and Figma or 
InVision like tools, and any number of business processes. So why are software developers still doing communication 
much the same way as thirty years ago?

There's a clue in Martin Fowler's [article on CI/CD](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) 
from 2006:
>When I've described this practice to people, I commonly find two reactions: "it can't work (here)" and 
"doing it won't make much difference". What people find out as they try it is that it's much easier than it sounds, 
and that it makes a huge difference to development. Thus the third common reaction is "yes we do that - how could you 
live without it?"

The software industry is, to a large degree, too busy to innovate on basic practices. That's why I felt such 
joy when I was first introduced to Scrum 15 years ago. "Wow!", I thought, "We're trying something new!" It did 
not occur to me that I would not see another commonly adopted change to the way developers communicate until Covid 
forced remote work mainstream.

### Why meeting all the time is too hot
Collaboration determines what we work on next and how we implement what we are working on now so there cannot be a more
important process. Let's take as many meetings as necessary! In fact let's use an open floor plan to encourage one 
continuous meeting all the time; nearly every introduction of Scrum I witnessed was closely followed by open offices.

And I get the logic - it's at least consistent. But now that almost everyone realizes the issues with an all day 
meeting environment, it's time to also see the limitations of meetings as a software developer communication tool.

You can't afford to have meetings all the time and, in an agile environment, you also can't afford to have your
approvals, questions and reviews wait for the next meeting. So if meetings are your only tool then your development 
process comes down to put up with open office like constant interruptions or suffer regularly doing the wrong thing or 
the wrong way.

### Why working by yourself is too cold
I'll admit there is a certain class of problems that are very amenable to working on with limited interaction with
others. Let's call them *yesterday's problems*. Yesterday's problems have fairly obvious solutions and if you need
extra hands for the grunt work you can employ a [code factory]({{site.baseurl}}/agile/2021/08/16/code-factory.html)
process.

Plus there is a straightforward technique to guarantee a large supply of yesterday's problems. On the
infrastructure side just pile up technical debt. On the feature side just let your competition do all the innovation.

However, for fixing today's problems minimal collaboration is a disaster. Even if you are the product
manager or chief architect new problems are too complex to take on without a lot of guiding opinions.

### Solving our Goldilocks problem
Once we admit we're facing a "just right" kind of choice, we should know that off the shelf solutions won't work. If
you are not willing to experiment with software methodology then you will end up with a lot of cold oatmeal and burnt
tongues. The process and tools that work for papa or mama bear don't necessarily suit you.

Certainly endless meetings and silo'ed development are available to everyone already. Now we have to focus on supporting 
other kinds of software development communication choices.
