When my co-founder, Ben, and I started looking at tools available to developers a strange pattern emerged. There are
developer specific tools for coding, code reviews and on call rotation, but for the rest of what a developer does there 
are only generic tools like Kanban boards (originally used in factories), chat, and meetings.

In fact, we stumbled even on terminology for the rest of what a developer does and so coined "product generation". 
The traditional face-to-face / open office product generation solution imagines that developers can be available for 
unlimited meetings and also continue to code at a high level.

## Why Most Meetings Don't Work for Developers
Brainstorming is useful but in general developer meetings have two fatal flaws: too much on the fly thinking 
about complex problems or repeatedly reviewing a book like document.

Meetings are a technology choice, but they have so far escaped being evaluated as we would for other tools.

Kanban boards."

But simply moving a meeting online doesn't guarantee success either. For instance, I was on a team had a spreadsheet
where we voted on priorities. A few of us assigned ourselves the top item but unfortunately the spreadsheet didn't
record the certainty or reasons behind the votes or give us a way to change the plan later. It turned out this 
project's popularity was a result of recent incidents in production and those incidents stopped and our code was never 
deployed.

## Reducing the Cost of Collaboration
The solution for meetings not being an effective tool has so far been - more meetings. Uclusion is a new approach:

* Spreading communication across a hodge podge of tools designed for other purposes, ends up with someone building
  the wrong thing or the wrong way.
* Neither in house nor customized generic tools can take on the complexity of curated workflows for product generation.
* To allow participation in parallel approval, reviews, grooming and design decisions on your own time, Uclusion
organizes and displays everything perfectly.

The greatest contribution Uclusion makes is to put the emphasis on product generation instead of status and chat.
