The daily routine of a software developer typically includes much more than just coding. Even including code reviews 
and reading and updating tickets still ignores much of the work a developer does.

When my co-founder, Ben, and I started looking at tools available to developers a strange pattern emerged. There are
developer specific tools for coding, code reviews, bug tracking and reporting like Kanban boards. For the rest of what
a developer does there are only generic tools like email, chat and meetings.

In fact, we stumbled for a long time even on the terminology for what a developer does. We needed a term for the larger
picture of a software developer's work activities and so coined "product generation". Therefore, the missing category
of software designed for developers are "product gen tools".

## An Asynchronous Flow
The daily flow that Uclusion allows for product generation is like this:
1. Create questions, suggestions, todos and unassigned jobs and build towards assigned jobs.
2. Pause jobs that are blocked or require input and help others with their paused.
3. Get feedback on jobs and give feedback on other's jobs.
4. Work from an inbox that tracks all of 1 - 3.
5. See a status display that shows exactly where you are on all the above.

All of these activities are what needs to happen **daily** in order to stay agile and 
[avoid writing unused code]({{site.baseurl}}/agile/2021/09/13/goldilocks-methodology.html). Even the 
[Scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) is clear on this point:
>The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work.

The face-to-face / open office solution to this problem imagines that developers can be available for all of these 
impromptu meetings and also continue to code at a high level.

## Why Most Meetings Don't Work for Developers
Meetings are a very good tool for brainstorming but for questions, status, feedback, suggestions, or approval they
have two fatal flaws:
* Point in time - think of the difference between a TV show that plays once a week and one that is on demand
* Too expensive - the expense is what usually drives time boxing them but that forces other problems

As a simple example of how these flaws are fatal let's take writing this blog. My process for writing it with Ben is:
1. Approval that the blog needed to be written - online / asynchronous
2. Every two days or so publish the blog to him and notify him that I need feedback and Ben reads the blog and 
comments - online / asynchronous
3. If I need help after his feedback then we brainstorm - short meeting / real time

Now suppose I had to use meetings for the same process.
1. Approval meeting - There will need to be an agenda for the meeting so my blog might not even be included. If included
   and approved I will need to estimate how long the blog will take so that we know when to schedule the next meeting. The
   whole meeting is time boxed so between approvals and estimates we are out of time and end up rubber-stamping a lot.
   Plus meetings tend be led by the loudest voices and recording who had what opinion is difficult in a meeting so those
   loudest voices are not even accountable.
2. Feedback - this is all on me to organize since no one in a daily meeting would have read the blog, and I can't
   afford to wait till the next demo meeting.
3. Brainstorming - not even a thing in a meeting driven process because the approval meeting would have tied me
   down to my very first ideas about this blog (and you don't want to read that one).

Meetings are a technology choice, but they have so far escaped being evaluated as we would for other tools.

Kanban boards."

My previous employer started experimenting with remote work long before Covid and there was push back
quoting the Agile Manifesto's face-to-face principle! If Star Wars technology becomes available will we reference a
20-year-old document to tell us whether to have hologram meetings or use hyperdrive?

But simply moving a meeting online doesn't guarantee success either. For instance, I was on a team had a spreadsheet
where we voted on priorities. A few of us assigned ourselves the top item but unfortunately the spreadsheet didn't
record the certainty or reasons behind the votes or give us a way to change the plan later. It turned out this 
project's popularity was a result of recent incidents in production and those incidents stopped and our code was never 
deployed.

## Reducing the Cost of Collaboration
Even a long email chain partially solves the point in time problem. It's the second problem, too expensive, that 
requires more complex software.

For Uclusion to implement product generation without all the meetings, we have to take all the drudge work
out of developer communication. In order to do this we have some design principles:
1. Uclusion knows as much as possible about what is happening in data input into it. For instance, unlike a generic
Kanban board, you have workflow stages that are not just a label like Todo or Done. If the software doesn't 
understand as much of the context as possible then drudge work cannot be automated and communication costs remain high.
2. Notifications must be sophisticated. Since Uclusion understand the actions a user can take, it can be smart
about who is notified, with what severity and when to automatically remove the notification.
3. Nothing should require immediate action. Uclusion has pipelined waiting stages like 'Requires Input' and 'Blocked'
and a continuous approval process. That way the development team is not forced to choose between to respond to 
everything immediately and risking making teammates idle.
4. Status should come as a result of just using Uclusion instead of being its own separate activity.

## Why is product generation important?
Software developers are businessmen. I say this in the sense that it is not at all trivial to produce value as a
software developer. There is no assembly line approach that guarantees you are moving the needle forward.

Most of the tools a software developer uses reflect the ever increasing difficulty and competition we face. Process and
product generation cannot be any different if we are to overcome the very large hurdles that software development
projects face.
