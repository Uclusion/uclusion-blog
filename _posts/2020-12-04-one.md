With wiki, group chat, email, issue trackers, Google docs and boards all readily available what is the 
best way to organize software development work? I argue that none of those tools do what you want.

### A developer's collaboration tools should be specifically built to make his life easier

1. Everything should be ready to go out of the box without my having build stuff, design the 
best way to use the tool or manually enforce guidelines.

1. There is some concept of a workspace
    * Everything about an endeavor is visible on one page
        * A wiki like area for requirements, ideas and context in general
        * A place for small, well defined tasks like bugs
        * Another area for stories that are next or actively being done
    * Any communication about the workspace topic should take place in the workspace - not group chat or email and if 
      we have to have a meeting its based on opinions already expressed in the workspace
1. Notifications handled intelligently instead of I subscribe or receive all edits spam

### Most collaboration software is a mishmash of scatter gun provided concepts based on an imagined assembly line of software development

Stories, epics, milestones, projects, boards, channels, issues - the more database entities capable of 
collecting information the better! Furthermore, what does a software developer *do* really? Most of this 
software seems to think developers have two modes:
* Receiving prioritized tasks from someone else
* Engaging in chat or meetings about how long before these assigned tasks are done

Accordingly, these collaboration tools mostly provide features around ranking lists of things to be done 
and trying to nail down when they will be finished. **The idea that the collaboration tool should help 
with deciding what to do or how is simply out of scope.**

Assuming that software development was as simple as receiving prioritized tasks and 
nailing down done, even then, most of these tools fail. The most primitive conception of a 
story life cycle still has to have some concept of review. Yes these tools may have a column or a label 
for in review but the expectation is that the story quickly passes out of this stage having already 
been fully specified ahead of time.

What about a story that requires input on requirements or design? Or a story in review which needs significantly more 
work?

### These common stories states are ignored by so called agile software because they are designed for a world where all the agile happens before a developer starts a story

Instead of being communication software with a dash of scheduling, these are scheduling tools 
with a dash of communications. The best that can be hoped for with such software is that it stays 
mostly out of a developer's way - but it's never going to actually help.
