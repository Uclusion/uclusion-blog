The world is cold and indifferent enough without daily using software that's not into to you. That's 
why most of the tools a software developer uses are tailored to his needs. Think of the tremendous 
effort behind an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), good source 
control or cloud computing services to anticipate and meet a developer's needs.

### Why should a developer's collaboration tools be any less specifically built to make life easier?

Developer centric collaboration software is built on principles that existing tools do not care about:
* All information related to a project should be organized with **built in** workflows for issues, stories and feature ideas / requirements
* The software should ask for and record opinions within the decision's context 
* Notifications should be sent automatically but only to those that need them
* At least three quarters of any meeting happens asynchronously first

Let's take some very simple collaboration examples out of the life of a software developer, say Fred, using software 
that cares. 

When Fred wants to plan his day he has an out of the box display of everything that needs 
doing across all projects and their current state. He can push a button to take him to new items in 
order of priority and see all previous notifications.

When Fred finishes a story he puts it into review and everyone is automatically notified. If anyone 
has feedback they can enter TODOs and when Fred closes the last TODO everyone will be automatically 
notified to review again.

When Fred opens a question his story moves to requires input and his team can choose which of the 
options that Fred associated with the question to approve or suggest their own.

When Fred creates a new story his team is instantly notified to approve with a certainty score and reason.

*So Fred enjoys the benefits of collaborating with his team without the usual hassle of some awkward 
combination of virtual sticky notes, wiki and chat.*

### Instead most collaboration software is encouraging developers to try to build their own by customizing

Unfortunately developers have a particular weakness for BYO solutions. Assembling or writing apps over 
a collaboration platform seems easy enough to Fred at the beginning and by the time the trap is recognized 
it might be too late. Then Fred is sitting on a mountain of customization and is loath to start over 
even though no one is happy with the result. Or upper management has seized upon some, actually counter 
productive, report coming out of the customization.

When I start up my IDE, even without changing anything, most utility runs quite well. But it could have 
gone another way - IDEs could have been all about reporting time spent coding or required massive 
configuration. They don't because ultimately developers knew better and demanded better.
