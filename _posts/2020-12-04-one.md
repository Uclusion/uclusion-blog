### Existing agile software underestimates learning during development

1. Agile happens during development - not before or after
1. Therefore agile software is about helping with the overhead and decision making to allow changing direction **while** coding

Instead most agile software thinks developers have two modes:
* Receiving prioritized tasks from someone else
* Engaging in chat or meetings about how long before these assigned tasks are done

**The idea that the collaboration tool should help with deciding what to do or how is simply out 
of scope.**

So many simplifying assumptions about collaboration are made

'Ready to Start' => 'In Progress' => 'In Review' => 'Verified'

* Stories in 'Ready to Start' come from a stable 'backlog' that just needs prioritization and is
ready for development without further changes.
* The story states - 'Requires Input', 'Blocked', and 'Not Doing' are rare events instead of a 
normal part of software development.
* A story 'In Review' quickly passes out of this stage having already been fully specified ahead of time.
* Implementation is something that can be determined ahead of time without actually trying to do the story.

With these assumptions instead of being communication software with a dash of scheduling, existing agile software
becomes scheduling tools with a dash of communications. The best that can be hoped for with such software is that it 
stays out of a developer's way; *it's never going to actually help*.

### So developer's see agile software as something to be endured instead of an important supporting tool

Kanban boards and 'lighter' than Jira tools became a hit with developers by simply being less of 
a burden than the alternative. Where tools like IDE editors, CI/CD and source control kept getting 
more and more sophisticated to positively help software development, developers were left with 
build your own solutions if they wanted anything like that for collaboration.

Even if you are willing to spend the time customizing, the results of build your own collaboration 
will be very limited. **So meetings, messaging and notes stored outside the tool being used end up 
filling the void left by unfriendly agile software.**

Which is to say the bulk of development currently needlessly happens without agile software assistance. 
That lack of assistance becomes even more unfortunate with trends in shorter release cycles, remote work and 
end user empowerment.
