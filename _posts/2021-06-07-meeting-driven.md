When most decisions require meetings, context switching is just the beginning of the 
consequences.

### Don't plan software in a meeting
Requiring an entire team to meet together to create a plan for the next
week or two causes more problems than it solves.

First in order to make that meeting work you need to estimate all the stories
so you know how many you can do before the next meeting. Your customers 
aren't paying you to produce estimates - time spent doing that on a regular 
basis is a distraction.

Second having spent a lot of time on a plan for the next iteration the team
will be very reluctant to change the plan; even when the plan is wrong. 
That wastes even more time.

So having a planning meeting makes a team spend more time estimating and less 
on value - just by the nature of meetings.

### Don't emphasize meeting skills
With meeting driven process you might end up with a meeting facilitator 
(Scrum master) and even communication tips being a large part of 1-1s with 
your manager. But how important are meeting skills to software development
really? Again customers aren't paying for your meeting skills.

The more structured communication that goes along with writing things down
is something every software developer is already familiar with from coding.
It's a far better fit for a team of engineers.

### Don't have a single agenda
Just by the nature of having full team meetings it becomes more likely
that everyone is encouraged to work on the same thing. For instance Scrum
has a Sprint goal. Concise agendas are good for meetings, but some team members needs to 
do technical debt and other essential tasks that don't need discussion with the entire team.

### Don't collect daily status
You have to update some tool for anyone to see status easily, so it doesn't make
sense to repeat that information in a meeting. Any form of once a day polling developers
will fail if the goal is to have them stay unblocked all the time.

### Don't do simple
Software is complex enough to ride on the edge of what most teams are capable of. Meetings excel
at simple presentations, executive summaries and single speakers. So meetings are a poor fit for most 
software development decisions.

### If meetings are frequently bad for software development why are they so common?
Avoiding meetings requires the right technology. If you try to reduce meetings with only group chat,
email and Kanban boards available then results will vary.
