This is not clickbait. You only need to read the definition of a planning meeting
to understand why.

>The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

Let's unpack what this definition means for your career.

#### You're responsible
>The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint.

You will be judged by whether your engineering team produces value. A product
owner might be measured by the results of many teams, but his role is to make
**proposals** to engineering.

This is problem #1 for planning meetings - they obfuscate who is responsible for 
what. The artifacts, if any, produced by a planning meeting don't state anyone's
opinions or reasons for approving the assigned stories.

You might think there is a division of labor where product owners 
and managers are responsible for what you do, and you only need worry about 
implementation. The reality is that few developers with that attitude will 
advance very far and likely your organization adopted agile project 
management to help move away from that kind of assembly line.

#### Even salesmen stopped using such high pressure
> The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

Or what? - we continue the meeting another day? This is problem #2 for planning meetings - gun to your 
head deadline is not a reasonable way to plan even a single story, much less all stories
for the next X weeks.

If you think about your career depending on these decisions then it becomes
obvious that we should decide on stories as we go. Also, not being able to
come up with a better plan in a short time frame doesn't make that plan worth 
doing.

There is rarely any shortage of technical debt that we know needs doing. Plus
implementing an unsuccessful feature can negatively impact a product's usage
complexity and maintenance. So the bar for a plan has to be higher than, "Time's up!"

#### Collaboration doesn't work that way
> The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.

The problem is the product backlog. In order for the planning meeting to work everything has to
be groomed ahead of time to an extent that's simply not possible.

Imagine your team is working on a comedy sketch show and you decide in a planning meeting which skits make
the cut. That might work because:
1. The skits can be fully written ahead of time
2. Decisions made for this week's show don't have much impact the following week

Software development is the opposite of that. You can't write the stories ahead of time and the decisions
made can have far-reaching impact.

This is problem #3 for the planning meeting - you won't get to agile by grooming backlogs because that
kind of detailed planning is the opposite of agile (sometimes referred to as waterfall).

#### Even for implementation planning meetings damage a career
Because a planning meeting only occurs once every X weeks a lot of extra care must be taken to make
sure the team doesn't run out of stories. 

First you need to estimate the stories before even starting. Otherwise you can't be certain you have enough stories. 

Second you may need to split the stories to make sure they can be done before the next meeting and that 
each member of the team has enough. 

Both pre-estimating and story splitting are bad news.

##### Pre-estimating
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/estimating.jpg" alt="Estimating" style="width: 75%;" />

If you're a plumber asked for an estimate you won't give one until you go under the house.
How can you? Without knowing anything about the pipes you were asked to fix, any
estimate you give will be meaningless.

Yet planning meetings routinely ask developer's to make estimates on stories 
without any investigation. These estimates can only damage the careers of the
engineers that made them.

It's okay to estimate a story once you've been working on it long enough to
comfortably give an answer. It's not okay to use anything other than a worst
case estimate for planning. Without going under the house I can only give you
an estimate on replacing your entire plumbing system or maybe even the whole 
house.

Whether to do a story or not should be based on its estimated value - not
its estimated implementation. If a story has high enough value then it 
should be worth it to have a developer investigate.

##### Story splitting
In terms of your career you want to be assigned to as large a story as possible, and it so happens
that's what's best for your product and customers as well. For instance if a story has
a back end and front end component the best case is it's assigned to a full stack developer or
developers who can do both.

The general principle is that if the resulting assignments are not independently valuable then 
try to avoid splitting the stories. The communication overhead of doing so is prohibitive
and there is no way to avoid blame for the delays caused by that overhead.

#### What to do about it
Historically planning meetings did have value. Compared to a single manager handing out assignments
without a meeting, a planning meeting where developers could help control what they work on is a huge
step up.

The problem is that for an agile organization planning meetings can never be more than a stepping 
stone towards developers, story by story, truly taking more responsibility for the work they do. 

So developers that want a career with better organizations have to move beyond planning meetings. Uclusion
offers project management software to help do that and encourages all developers to find solutions.
