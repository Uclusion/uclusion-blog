I wish the title were clickbait but you only need to read the definition of a planning meeting
to understand why this is so important.

>The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

Let's unpack what this definition means for your career.

#### You're responsible
>The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint.

You will be judged by whether your engineering team produces value. A product
owner might be measured by the results of many teams, but his role is to make
**proposals** to engineering.

This is problem #1 for planning meetings - they obfuscate who is responsible for 
what. The artifacts, if any, produced by a planning meeting don't state anyone's
opinions or reasons for approving the assigned stories.

You might think there is a division of labor where product owners 
and managers are responsible for what you do, and you only need worry about 
implementation. The reality is that you will be held responsible no matter
whose idea it was and team responsibility is a primary reason for moving to agile.

#### Even though you're responsible, your ideas won't be heard 
> The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

Another failing of meetings is that they usually have a single agenda. 
This is problem #2 for planning meetings - planning all stories for the next X weeks in a day
is unreasonable, so the first proposed agenda probably carries even if it's inferior.

There is rarely any shortage of technical debt that we know needs doing. Plus
implementing an unsuccessful feature can negatively impact a product's usage
complexity and maintenance. 

Yet instead of rational offline debate the team re-enacts a scene out of '12 Angry Men'.
Even with it affecting your career are you going to be the lone dissenting voice that keeps everyone 
trapped in a room?

#### Groomed backlogs won't save you
> The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.

Since you're responsible and there's not enough time to introduce your ideas, your
only hope for avoiding career damage is to influence the product backlog ahead of time.

This is problem #3 for the planning meeting - grooming backlogs well ahead of time creates 
detailed plans that are the opposite of agile. (Sometimes referred to as waterfall.)

So you need to put your perfect story onto the backlog immediately before the planning meeting and then
have meetings right before the meeting to get it on the agenda! But even then your perfect story
might not be so perfect once the Sprint starts and it's a long way till the next planning meeting.

#### Planning meetings hurt your reputation
Because a planning meeting only occurs once every X weeks a lot of extra care must be taken to make
sure the team doesn't run out of stories. 

First you need to estimate the stories to be certain you have enough. 

Second you may need to split the stories to make sure they can be done before the next meeting and that 
each member of the team has enough. 

Both pre-estimating and story splitting are bad news for your reputation.

##### Pre-estimating
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/estimating.jpg" alt="Estimating" style="width: 75%;" />

If you're a plumber asked for an estimate you won't give one until you go under the house.
How can you? Without knowing anything about the pipes you were asked to fix, any
estimate you give will be meaningless.

If a story has high enough value then it should be worth it to have a developer investigate until
he's comfortable giving a real estimate. Otherwise, you're giving out estimates that are mostly wrong 
and that's going to hurt your reputation.

##### Story splitting
In terms of your career you want to be assigned to as large a story as possible, and it so happens
that's what's best for your product and customers as well. For instance if a story has
a back end and front end component the best case is it's assigned to a full stack developer or
developers who can do both.

If the resulting assignments are not independently valuable then try to avoid splitting the stories. 
The communication overhead of doing so is prohibitive and there is no way to avoid blame for the delays 
caused by that overhead.

#### What to do about it
Historically planning meetings did have value. Compared to a single manager handing out assignments
without a meeting, a planning meeting where developers could help control what they work on is a huge
step up.

The problem is that for an agile organization planning meetings can never be more than a stepping 
stone towards developers, story by story, truly taking more responsibility for the work they do. 

So if you want a lasting career with a better organization, you have to move beyond planning meetings. 
Uclusion offers project management software to help do that and encourages all developers to find 
solutions.
