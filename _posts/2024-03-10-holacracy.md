To its credit holacracy has a meeting [process](https://www.holacracy.org/constitution/5-0/#art32) whose agenda cannot 
be dominated by a minority of the attendees. However, just as with Scrum, Kanban, etc., regular cold meetings will 
always be awful.

{% include callout.html

In sales a cold meeting is with an unknown client but for a developer it's having to weigh in real time on 
previously unknown decisions.

**TL;DR**: signup for [Uclusion](https://uclusion.com) and immediately be put into a sandbox demo (shown below)
with a team whose decisions start asynchronously.

## Job approval
You're a developer with an idea that needs coding, and you want the team's opinion on whether the idea adds value.

With Uclusion you have a good chance of getting the approvals you want without a meeting but if there is a
meeting everyone has already thought about your proposal and basic questions have been answered asynchronously.

Forcing the team to decide on your idea a few minutes after seeing it for the first time is going to be stressful
for you and everyone else <b>and with Uclusion that won't happen</b>.

## Job clarification
Uclusion questions and suggestions put you in charge of an asynchronous implementation decision.

Even if someone proposes their own implementation option, it can't be voted on until you move the
option from proposed.

## Warm status
Where are we on coding X is a typical cold meeting question that bogs down the whole meeting with answers that are out 
of date soon after the meeting is over. A Kanban board captures done or not done but that's not a real status.

### Collaboration driven status
When a job assignee opens a question, suggestion, or blocker in his job the job automatically
moves to Assistance Needed.

The help hopefully comes outside a meeting but even if not the meeting doesn't have to waste time
establishing what jobs need help and why.

### Up-to-date estimates
After a few days with no estimate or an expired estimate, Uclusion enforces the input of an estimated completion date 
on any accepted job. If one is not provided the job is automatically moved back to the approval stage.

This estimate can be changed at any time and a notification of the change will be sent to the group.

**We hope you will consider [Uclusion](https://uclusion.com) for your team's development communication and maximize
uninterrupted hours coding.**
