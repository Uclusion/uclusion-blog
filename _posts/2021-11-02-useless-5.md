that other people owe you is synchronous water cooler process."

With water cooler process your team is either altogether in the same room or having enough synchronous meetings to 
simulate being altogether. Water cooler process evolved because it was better than the chaos that results from not 
communicating with a team at all. Unfortunately, altogether in a room or its equivalent in virtual meetings and group 
chat prevents the focus necessary to get anything done.

By now many of us have experienced what interruption free concentration is like and even post Covid will not be willing
to sacrifice that style of work.

## Second class collaboration will cause second class remote work
Water cooler process revolved around first class assignments and meetings. These assignments and meetings are tracked,
facilitated and supported by tooling. 

The communication across assignments and outside of meetings that does the real heavy lifting for agile software 
development is second class. Traditionally developers were simply dumped in the same room to insure this communication 
happens. It wasn't tracked, facilitated or supported by any tooling.

If developers continue to rely on synchronous process tools then remote work will always be the red-headed
stepchild of the working world. A Zoom call is inferior to us meeting face to face and we want the best for our
developers.

it's good for: brainstorming, teaching and socializing."

## What first class asynchronous collaboration looks like
Water cooler process is not a good solution for team planning, status, helping, feedback and continuous improvement. 
All of these functions should be performed asynchronously in communications software.

When you need someone's approval, feedback or help, you should be able to accomplish it asynchronously in a project
management tool and what that person owes you should be tracked as just as important as any assigned coding.

This means completely changing the way we traditionally think about tracking code. The code's not "done" if I'm still 
waiting on other people's opinions. Having to change the code for feedback isn't the exception, it's the rule.

Similarly approval for me to start on a feature isn't something to be swept under the meeting rug. Approvals can
happen at any time, their completion is tracked, and the resulting approvals recorded in the full detail of by whom and
how certain.

## How we get there
Uclusion and others like Loom and Figma are building the first generation of asynchronous first tools.  Just like 
the mobile first wave of innovation, the key is for consumers to stop accepting tools that don't fit their needs.

Unfortunately, you'll see a lot of blogs claiming traditional tools are asynchronous. If a tool doesn't allow 
full communication inside of it, as opposed to being paired with a group chat offering, it's not asynchronous. If a tool
is meant to be used in conjunction with synchronous meetings then it's a synchronous tool.

There's going to be some confusion at first but the future of work doesn't revolve around the water cooler.
