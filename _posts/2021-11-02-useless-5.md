content="Developers need to know two things to collaborate: what they need to do for others, and what others need to do 
for them. Traditionally, this has been done by throwing everyone into the same office: a.k.a. the water cooler."

With water cooler process your team is either altogether in the same room or having enough synchronous meetings to 
simulate being altogether. Water cooler process evolved because it was better than the chaos that results from not 
communicating with a team at all. Eventually even cubicles were considered too isolating.

Unfortunately, altogether in a room or its equivalent in virtual meetings and group chat prevents the focus necessary 
to get anything done. By now many of us have experienced what interruption free concentration is like and even post 
Covid will not be willing to sacrifice that style of work.

## Second class collaboration will cause second class remote work
Water cooler process revolved around first class assignments and meetings. These assignments and meetings are tracked,
facilitated and supported by tooling. 

The communication across assignments and outside of meetings that does the real heavy lifting for agile software 
development is traditionally second class. It wasn't tracked, facilitated or supported by any tooling. 

You would go to another developer to ask a question with hat in hand after first doing an awkward dance to even be 
noticed. As if you and the other developer were not commuting two or more hours a day just to make the teamwork possible.

If developers continue to rely on synchronous process tools then remote work will always be the red-headed
stepchild of the working world. A Zoom call is inferior to us meeting face to face, and we want the best for our
developers.

it's good for: brainstorming, teaching and socializing."

## What first class asynchronous collaboration looks like
When you need someone's approval, feedback or help, you should be able to accomplish it asynchronously in a project
management tool and what that person owes you should be tracked as just as important as any assigned coding.

This means completely changing the way we traditionally think about tracking code. The code's not "done" if I'm still 
waiting on other people's opinions. Having to change the code for feedback isn't the exception, it's the rule.

Similarly, approval for me to start on a feature isn't something to be swept under the meeting rug. Approvals can
happen at any time, their completion is tracked, and the resulting approvals recorded with full detail of by whom and
how certain.

## How we get there
Uclusion and others like Loom and Figma are building the first generation of asynchronous first tools.  Just like 
the mobile first wave of innovation, the key is for consumers to stop accepting tools that don't fit their needs.

Unfortunately, you'll see a lot of blogs claiming traditional tools are asynchronous. If a tool doesn't allow 
full communication inside of it, as opposed to being paired with a group chat offering, it's not asynchronous. If a tool
is meant to be used in conjunction with synchronous meetings then it's a synchronous tool.

There's going to be some confusion at first but the future of work doesn't revolve around the water cooler.
