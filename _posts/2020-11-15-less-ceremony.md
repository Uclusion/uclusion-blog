We need less ceremony and more agile.

We work in the fastest paced, the fastest growing, most competitive industry in 
existence. We face chronic, common problems with architecture, customer access,
testing strategy and technical debt.

And every software development project is brand new because if it were already
done, the exact way you are doing it then there would be no point.

In the face of this overwhelming need to adapt and innovate we schedule a
meeting every 2 weeks or so with this agenda:

>The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.

In an era when there are still [books written](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/dying-paycheck) about
the dangers of workplace stress, it's good that Scrum recognizes the need for
improvement enough to have a ceremony.

However, we have to do a lot better than a periodic meeting with the agenda of
let's chat about how it's going and tweak our Definition of Done. Going around
the room asking how the last 2 weeks went would be laughable if there weren't
serious overtime, stress and quality of life issues at stake.

Then, to this already doomed meeting, the Scrum guide adds a time limit.
>It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint.

### How Real Retrospection Works for Developers
For managers and executives a periodic 3-hour meeting isn't a joke at all.
Some of them have the skills and time to get an agenda set ahead of 
such a meeting, create great presentations for the meeting, and the work the
room to get to yes.

However, few if any of them would be able to do that at the end of a grueling
Sprint when everyone just wants to relax a bit before the next iteration. For a developer,
the format of a retrospective is unnecessarily making things very difficult.

Developer's need a fully asynchronous system to collect opinions and modify proposals during 
the Sprint. You frequently see this kind of debate between developers in tickets opened against 
open source. However, a single developer owns a ticket, so the system handling a team decision must be 
more complex.

Should you bring up switching to asynchronous retrospection in your next retrospective? That approach
might not be effective.

We suggest starting small by writing your proposal for replacing retrospectives and sending it out
ahead of your retrospective. Once these kinds of proposals become popular you can check out a tool 
like Uclusion that asynchronously handles retrospectives and all other kinds of ceremonies.
