If you want to be truly effective in today's work environment **no meeting should be scheduled that hasn't been 
attempted asynchronously first**.

This is because group meeting time is hard to get, incredibly costly, and must be used as effectively as possible.

Which of these looks like a better use of time?
1. "Hello, thanks for joining. We have options A, B, and C, with the following justifications..."
1. "Hello, we need to decide on what we're going to move forward, any ideas?"

The former is going to be an effective meeting and the latter probably not conclude anything.

Applying this principle to development ceremonies means that the bulk of the work needs to move into agile software and any scheduled meetings just
concern themselves with follow up.
For example, your daily Standups can focus on team cohesion, or in depth discussion that usually is relegated to the "parking lot".

### Isn't asynchronous collaboration more difficult?

Many times the information necessary for asynchronous collaboration is already being written down - just scattered
across group chat, issue trackers, wiki, etc. Other times everything is there but the system it is written in has
no ability to record opinions. To really put it together means using agile software designed specifically for
collaboration.

### Doesn't our agile process specify the exact ceremonies?

*No credible agile process exactly specifies the ceremonies*. For the daily standup, scrumguides.org says, `The 
structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses
on progress toward the Sprint Goal.` If you are stuck on an island with a conch shell as the only technology then by
all means pass the shell. If better technology is available then you should avail yourself of it.
