Scrum is an attempt to do agile software development with meetings. 
However using meetings limits Scrum's agility.

For instance if you have a planning meeting and plan one or two weeks ahead 
then you are already less agile. So you then try to have a daily meeting to 
adjust the plan if necessary but even a daily meeting happens only every 24 
hours so then [Scrum says](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum):

>The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work.

Once you choose meetings as your tool it's a tough rode to stay agile. The 
meetings attempt to fix a plan are by definition counter to the idea of agile.

This principle can be applied to development ceremonies in general because
a planning meeting plans, a daily standup plans and a retrospect is a planning
meeting for team improvement. The end of sprint demo is a planning meeting
for corrections that should have been incorporated agiley to make it into 
the next sprint.

### Breaking from meeting driven process just requires the right software

Many times the information necessary for asynchronous collaboration is already 
being written down - just scattered across group chat, issue trackers, wiki, 
etc. Other times everything is there but the system it is written in has
no ability to record opinions. To really put it together means using agile 
software designed specifically for project management without meetings.

If you are stuck on an island with a conch shell as the only technology then 
by all means pass the shell. If better technology is available then you should 
avail yourself of it.
